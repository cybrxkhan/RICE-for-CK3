[h1]Latest Version Released 2/20/22, compatible with vanilla patch 1.5.X[/h1]

This is a compatibility patch for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273832430][B]Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (RICE)[/B][/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2507209632][B]Ethnicities & Portraits Expanded (EPE)[/B][/url].

RICE is already compatible with EPE. However, by default, RICE’s new cultures will use vanilla ethnicities (i.e. the physical appearance of characters) rather than the ethnicities added by EPE - this compatch changes that, so RICE’s new cultures now use EPE’s ethnicities as appropriate.

[B]For load order, put this compatch AFTER RICE and EPE[/B]. The order of RICE and EPE does not matter.

While I think you can add this compatch to an existing save game, please note that it will not affect any existing characters so it is recommended you use this with new playthroughs.

No compatch is needed for CFP+RICE. However, if you are using CFP, EPE, and RICE, you will need both the RICE+EPE compatch AND the CFP+EPE compatch. The CFP+EPE compatch can be downloaded here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2507220129

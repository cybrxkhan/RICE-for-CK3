[h1]Latest Version Released 10/30/22, compatible with vanilla patch 1.7.X[/h1]

This is an optional compatibility patch for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273832430][B]Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (RICE)[/B][/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2507209632][B]Ethnicities & Portraits Expanded (EPE)[/B][/url].

RICE is already compatible with EPE. However, by default, RICE’s new cultures will use vanilla ethnicities (i.e. the physical appearance of characters) rather than ethnicities added by EPE - this compatch changes that, so RICE’s new cultures use EPE’s ethnicities as appropriate.

[B]For load order, put this compatch AFTER both RICE and EPE[/B]. Per the EPE team, RICE should be before EPE in the load order.

While I think you can add this compatch to an existing save game, please note that it will not affect any existing characters so it is recommended you use this with new playthroughs.

No compatch is needed for CFP+RICE. However, if you are using CFP and EPE, you will need the CFP+EPE compatch. The CFP+EPE compatch can be downloaded here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2507220129
















At long last, I am proud to announce the release of RICE's next flagship flavor pack, and its largest, most intricate, and most ambitious update yet: the **North Atlantic Flavor Pack: From Iceland to Vinland**! You can [download RICE here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273832430) on Steam.

This update, roughly three months in the making, focuses on the dynamic and underrated frontier of medieval Eurasia and the Americas. The new flavor includes RICE's first struggle, the *Colonization of Greenland*, several Native American cultures, new decisions like expeditions to the west, and much more! (Do note all Greenland and Americas flavor is off-map.)

# North Atlantic Features

Explore a land of myth and legend in a brand new struggle

* Relive the history of Norse Greenland in RICE’s first struggle, the **Colonization of Greenland**
* Help keep the Greenland settlements afloat by tracking Greenland's **Resilience** and **Networks**
* As a Native American, pull a “sunset invasion” with the **Native Sovereignty** decision!

Embark on a journey to settle the shores of a new world

* Choose the right courtiers to send on **expeditions** to explore the west as you follow in the footsteps of Erik the Red and Leif Erikson
* Establish a family **estate** in Greenland to profit from the colony in various ways, such as walrus hunts
* Focus more on profitable Greenland, or waste money on a risky, vain quest to settle distant **Vinland**

Encounter new cultures and faiths across two continents

* **New cultures** from Icelanders to the Inuit and the Beothuk add plenty of diversity to the North Atlantic
* New **traditions** and **innovations** enrich the cultures of the region, like the Master Whalers tradition for the Basques
* Many new **events** ranging from meeting Native Americans to the wildlife of the north provide more regional flavor.

While I've done basic testing to ensure the update runs smoothly, the complexity and amount of content in this update is unprecedented in RICE (and any mod I've done for Crusader Kings), so there may be some bugs and balance issues. Next, while I try to make major updates play nicely with old saves, I highly recommend starting a new game if you're playing in the North Atlantic region as there may be some wonkiness with the struggle due to the unprecedented size and scope of this update.

A bugfix patch will likely be out in a day or two. There are still a number of things that need to be tweaked and added, but that will be saved for later as I will be extremely busy in November and can't do much modding.

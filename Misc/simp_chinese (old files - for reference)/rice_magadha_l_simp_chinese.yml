It’s not the worst vice in the world, but now that Vassa is well under way, I find my impatience has been getting the best of me. Why can’t my cravings for luxury go away?

 magadha.0078.t:0 "A Monastery Needs Help"
 magadha.0078.desc:0 "I have heard one of the local monasteries is short on supplies or food. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] can simply go out to beg for alms.\n\nHowever, during Vassa, [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are discouraged from traveling outside of monasteries, and there are strict regulations about this. Even if they have a justified reason, it is the responsibility of laity such as myself to assist them so they can focus on their spiritual practice."
 magadha.0078.a:0 "Why should I get involved?"
 magadha.0078.b:0 "Give the monastery some alms."
 magadha.0078.c:0 "Donate a lot to the monastery!"
 magadha.0079.t:0 "Listening to a Sermon"
 magadha.0079.desc:0 "Although the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are mainly focused on meditation, chanting, and other religious practices during Vassa, some will also take time to give sermons to laity such as myself when we visit to give them alms. Today, I attended one such sermon by a famous [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], who expounded on various topics related to the Buddha’s teachings. Hearing such wise and thoughtful words really helped me in my attempts to restrain from engaging in vice and indulgence."
 magadha.0079.a:0 "It is good I attended this sermon."
 magadha.0080.t:0 "Chanting"
 magadha.0080.desc:0 "Today, as part of Vassa, I am chanting various [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures to myself. It is helping me focus, certainly, so that I may be able to better improve myself spiritually."
 magadha.0080.a:0 "In the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha…"
 magadha.0081.t:0 "Can't Find Nothing"
 magadha.0081.desc:0 "One issue, if I want to call it that, during Vassa is that sometimes it isn’t always easy to buy food and drink. Just as many people try to cut down on excess indulgence during this time, even shopkeepers and merchants will cut down on how much of such indulgent products they sell. Unfortunately, I’m having difficulty buying enough of these products to serve for some upcoming functions and gatherings I’ll be hosting.\n\nNow, given I am not a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], it isn’t necessarily a problem if I want to buy some of these things (within reason), especially if it would help me with my various duties and responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. But I have agreed to abstain from vices this year, or at least reduce them, so perhaps this is an opportunity for me to put that into practice and do what I’d say I’d do…."
 magadha.0081.a:0 "As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I can’t let others see me in squalor."
 magadha.0081.b:0 "Yes, perhaps I will wait until later to buy these things."
 magadha.0082.t:0 "Wisdom and Insight"
 magadha.0082.desc:0 "Some of the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are aware of my vow to abstain from vices during this Vassa, and have commended me for setting an example to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] community, or the Sangha. One [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] in particular, has taken a great interest in providing me pointers and advice on how to manage myself and practice the teachings of the Buddha, on top of the usual responsibilities and duties such a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] would have during Vassa."
 magadha.0082.a:0 "I greatly appreciate the wisdom and insight."

Monastics from all over come to study and exchange ideas about philosophy, religion, linguistics and translation, and more.

He has become, in recent years, the subject of veneration by locals who have attributed many miracles to him.

It appears a number of happenings related to my military were due to his influence, calling upon God to aid me in my time of need.\n\nAs a result, today, I have decided to pay my respects to this great man myself by visiting his tomb in the town of Beverley which he founded (located in [beverley_location.GetNameNoTier]).

The hunters were horrified at what they did in the heat of passion; as the hermit lay dying, he told them [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] would forgive their sin if they and their descendants carry out a ritual every year.\n\nSince then, the people of Whitby perform an annual ritual where they construct a short hedge from stakes woven together.

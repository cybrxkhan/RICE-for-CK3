RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]I do NOT recommend adding RICE to existing saves. A new game is advised to be safe.[/U][/B]

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatibility]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through history code. Compatches are available for:

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that include new activities, decisions, events, music, and more. Read the [url=https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/RICE][B]RICE wiki[/B][/url] and [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

There are currently [B]39[/B] new flavor packs, shown on this map:

By default, RICE uses the original English text as a placeholder so you won't see gibberish for other languages.

_“Hail flood! Emerging from the earth, arriving to bring Egypt to life, hidden of form, the darkness in the day….”_

_- Opening lines of an ancient Egyptian Hymn to the Nile flood_

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is a WIP version and not necessarily stable!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod manually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.

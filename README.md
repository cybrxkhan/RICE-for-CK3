_“After being tossed about at sea for a long time, Leif chanced upon land where he had not expected any to be found. Fields of self-sown wheat and vines were growing there. [....] Leif converted the country [Greenland] to Christianity. Afterward he became known as Leif the Lucky.”_

_- Two excerpts from the Saga of Erik the Red_

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. RICE's guiding philosophy is to keep a focused scope that won't change gameplay significantly, but instead adds flavor across the world that is grounded in historical authenticity, especially for lesser-known places and peoples.

RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and is technically compatible with most mods; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history. If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord! Also feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is a WIP version and not necessarily stable!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: **If you are re-installing a mod manually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! It's a good habit to do to prevent potential issues.**

## Latest Changelog

### 1.7.2.b Hotfix for "Leif Erikson"

- Added new CBs that are functionally identical to the county and ducal conquest CBs for rulers in the Greenland struggle to use on those outside the struggle, as a workaround for the issue where the CBs we're disabled, to avoid editing vanilla code
- Added counties of North Riding (York), Dublin, and Middlesex (i.e. London) and the Duchy of Mann to the Greenland struggle region
- Added Eeyou (East Cree) and Innu names (credits again to Lahom for finding Native American names for me)
- Decision to explore Greenland is disabled for pre-medieval dates (like in TFE and WTWSMS)
- Reduced the discount you get on the decision to explore Greenland if you took the Icelandic Althing decision/are of North Germanic or Goidelic heritage
- Increased the base cost of the decision to explore Greenland to 250
- Increased how much Resilience and Networks can potentially increase when taking the decision to Support Greenland
- Reduced failure rate of Supporting Greenland to 20% (was previously 30%)
- Support Greenland decision now clarifies how much Resilience and Networks can potentially increase for each type of support
- Tweaked Resilience penalty for hunting trips to Nordsetur to be a bit more forgiving, especially for major and great hunts
- Increased grace period between each Vinland outpost failure from one year to five years (i.e. during the grace period, outposts will not fail)
- Reduced the impact of Viability on the chances of Vinland outposts failing - Viability now increases the chances at half rate normally, and a fifth rate after the Greenland struggle is resolved with a good ending (it’s still going to be tough) 
- Reduced the chances of Vinland outposts failing if the Greenland struggle has been resolved with a good ending
- Fixed Marginalization phase decreasing the chances of Vinland outposts failing instead of increasing it

- Fixed localization error for the Decision to Explore the Seas West of Greenland

### 1.7.2.a Hotfix for "Leif Erikson"

- Separated Native American heritages and languages in the code for some compatibility issues with Cultures Expanded and potentially other mods, like everyone getting the Native American decision or having no beards (this does not resolve CCU-related issues)
- Added catalyst for the Greenland struggle when taking the decision to Incorporate Inuit Ideas
- Added localization for Native American ethnicities
- Changed culture colors to HSV values for languages for better compatibility with other mods
- Decision to Send an Expedition to the West (and thus start the Greenland struggle) now requires having a capital in the struggle region, rather than just having any county in it
- Decision to Convene Iceland’s First Althing now properly displays the requirement that your capital needs to be in Iceland
- Both decisions to Establish Ivory Carving Centers no longer require needing a coastal county, and require having at least 10 development instead
- Fixed missing lines of code in Native American ethnicities files (added in “using = finnish”)

### 1.7.2 "Leif Erikson"

- Added North Atlantic Flavor Pack: From Iceland to Vinland
- Added 3 Renaissance, 4 Norse, and 1 Celtic themed soundtracks
- Added a few loading screens
- Added a lot of new German translations (thanks to Dillo234 again!)
- Armies from Silk Road Communities are no longer inheritable
- Celtic music now also plays in a slightly broader range in Northern Europe
- Reduced chances AI will take decision to Request a Coronoation by the Ọọ̀ni (to prevent spam in the mid to late game)
- Uncrowned by Ooni modifier will no longer be given to Baron-tier characters
- Baron-tier characters can no longer take the decision to Request a Coronoation by the Ọọ̀ni (to prevent spam in the mid to late game)
- Fixed Lop Nur announcement event triggering globally (for TFE and early start dates)
- Miscellaneous bugfixes

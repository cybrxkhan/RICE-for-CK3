# Geographical regions
# Regions can be declared with one or more of the following fields:
#	duchies = { }, takes duchy title names declared in landed_titles.txt
#	counties = { }, takes county title names declared in landed_titles.txt
#	provinces = { }, takes province id numbers declared in /history/provinces
#	regions = { }, a region can also include other regions, however the subregions needs to be declared before the parent region. 
#		E.g. If the region world_europe contains the region world_europe_west then world_europe_west needs to be declared as a region before (i.e. higher up in this file) world_europe.

# Regions provide the following modifiers:
# key + _development_growth
# key + _development_growth_factor
# This requires "generate_modifiers = yes" in the region

# DAJU KING LIST
# 
# Cybrxkhan notes:
# Based on several king lists of the Daju compiled from various sources, mostly oral tradition, mentioned in Andrew McGregor's thesis on Darfur history (see link below).
# These lists are likely highly unreliable the further back in time we go due to the telescoping effect in oral traditions.
# The king lists also use a lot of Islamic names which doesn't necessarily discredit the existence of rulers, it is possible historical pagan rulers were given Islamic names
# The kinglists are also contradictory even if some names are recurring (for instance, Ahmad al-Daj is listed as the last Sultan in most lists, but the first in another)
# The longest kinglist even traces the Daju back to the Abbasid caliphs going back to Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammed
# 
# Side note: Where possible, I've used the versions of these names found in vanilla's namelists, so they correspond, rather than the spelling in the original French transliteration of the king-list
# 
# For more info, see the chapter on the Daju in Andrew McGregor's Darfur (Sudan) in the Age of Stone Architecture c. AD 1000 - 1750

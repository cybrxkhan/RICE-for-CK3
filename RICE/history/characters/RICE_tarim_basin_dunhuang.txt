# Relevant quote:
# "Although Korea is a relative latecomer to this field of study, the international academic community has acknowledged that direct links between Korea, Dunhuang and Central Asia are evident from both the Dunhuang wall paintings as well as the manuscripts. A total of 492 Dunhuang caves has been identified and studied, and Korean envoys wearing feather caps (characteristic of Korean officials in ancient times) are depicted in murals of the Tang period (618–907) including those in caves 220, 237, 332, and 335 (see above). These are certainly of great interest3 as they are evidence that Koreans travelled westward passing through Dunhuang.""

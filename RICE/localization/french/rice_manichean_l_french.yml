 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_name: "Mani's Emanation"
 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_desc: "When the followers of Mani – the final Prophet, the Apostle of Jesus Christ, the Buddha of Light – had lost all hope against the forces of [faith.DevilName], whose minions persecuted them around the world, [reviver.GetTitledFirstName] led the faithful to reclaim [GetGeographicalRegion('world_mesopotamia').GetName], the sacred home of Mani, and reintroduce his teachings there."
 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_chapter_opening_new_title: "There were dark days, when [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.DevilName] seemed to have defeated the devout followers of Mani at every turn. Oppression and descreation of the Church was commonplace, and even many members of the Church had fallen to sin and despair." 
 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "But not everything had gone against the Church, praise Mani! The Church lost its way, but gained a new champion in the great and powerful [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] had seen how destitute and impoverished the Manichean community had become, how weak it seemed in the face of Darkness. Yet [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] knew they had to fight hard to defend and liberate the Light."
 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "Gathering a force of righteous Elect and Hearers, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] swept into the abundant plains of the Fertile Crescent, the homeland of Mani, and cast aside the sinful, ferocious forces of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.DevilName]. The followers of Mani returned to power between the Tigris and Euphrates, and under [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] leadership, began rebuilding the Church there."

 RICE_manichean_reviver_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "The return of Mani's Church to the Fertile Crescent and its subsequent renewal is nothing short of a miracle. Yet such a miracle was only made possible through the heroic deeds of the Elect and Hearers who, under the guidance and authority of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], fought hard against the evil of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.DevilName]. There is no doubt that centuries from now, the Manichean Church will continue to honor [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] name, and consider [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHim] equal to the Apostles of Mani due to [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] efforts to rescue and proselytize the Religion of Light."

Manicheism was a religion popular among the merchants of the Silk Road, particularly the Sogdians and Uyghurs, who frequently used Manichean monasteries and houses of worship as banks and storage centers. When the Tang Dynasty of China persecuted the Manicheans in the 9th century, for example, they confiscated not only goods and wealth belonging to Manichean religious institutions, but also those belonging to the Manichean merchants who stored such goods and wealth at those sites."

However, because these prophets did not write down their teachings (unlike Mani), their later followers misunderstood and misinterpreted their original teachings. Mani in particular seems to have had a strong admiration for Jesus, which is reflected in Manicheism itself, and later Manicheans often compared Mani to Jesus, such as calling Mani’s martyrdom his Passion, akin to Jesus. Even later Islamic sources, such as that of the Persian theologian ‘Abd al-Jabbar (935 – 1025 CE), noted that the Manicheans insisted they were the ‘real’ followers of Christ, who possessed the true gospel.

This is an actual line from the Dublin Kephalaia, a manuscript originally found in Egypt, likely belonging to an Egyptian Manichean community from late antiquity.

The Dublin Kephalaia’s contents, written in the Coptic language, reveal a community with knowledge of different religions’ beliefs and issues, indicating it was created in a multicultural, multireligious milieu. Interestingly, the original papyrus manuscript was badly damaged after centuries of wear and tear, burial, soaking in liquid, painted over, and so on, so much that it was only until 2007 that scholars were able to use modern technology – mainly multispectral and computer-enhanced photographic techniques – to painstakingly translate the writing.

In China, Manicheans were called “vegetarian demon worshippers,” particularly during the Song Dynasty, perhaps due to the Manicheans’ emphasis on vegetarianism as a way to liberate their souls and the Light. The term was pervasive enough that it was used to label other heterodox cults that did not conform to more orthodox religious teachings like that of Buddhism or Confucianism, to the point that some scholars have called into question whether certain supposedly Manichean sects or rebel groups during this period were even Manichean – it is possible they were labeled “vegetarian demon worshippers” to discredit them."

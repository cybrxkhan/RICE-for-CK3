Though Ya‘qub‘s attack has traditionally been interpreted as a sign of his power-hungry, even irreligious nature, it is possible that he, as a holy warrior, may have seen Al-Mu‘tamid as unworthy and sought to replace him with a more deserving Abbasid.\n\nYa‘qub passed away in 879 and while his status as a proto-nationalist is perhaps a touch exaggerated, there is no doubt that his career marked the early stages of the disintegration of Abbasid authority in Iran, and the rise of various Iranian potentates."
 yazd.0003.b.info:0 "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! Amr ibn al-Layth, a brother of Ya‘qub, was the second ruler of the Saffarid Dynasty. Similarly to his brother, he also had humble origins as a stone mason and mule driver before he joined the #italic ‘ayyar#!.\n\nYa‘qub, who apparently never had children or a wife, preferred for his other brother Ali to succeed him; however, thanks to some intrigue, Amr emerged on top. Much of his early reign was focused on restoring order to various territories that had slipped from Ya‘qub‘s authority while the latter was distracted in the west. Eventually, Amr and the Caliph Al-Mu‘tamid even had to put aside their differences, given various Iranian warlords who threatened their mutual interests.\n\nThe Samanids were the ones to undo Amr, defeating him in 900 CE. Though Amr was technically the Caliph‘s representative, the Caliph must have found his erstwhile ally‘s defeat expedient; the Samanids sent Amr to the Caliph in chains, and he was later executed.\n\nThough Amr‘s descendants survived and ruled as petty lords for another century, they would never reach their apogee of power again."

Eventually, Tahir and his brother Ya‘qub got into conflict with Sebük-Eri, who allied himself with the Caliph.\n\nThough Tahir and Ya‘qub were defeated, Sebük-Eri‘s good fortunes did not last long; his ambitions were dashed when the Caliph sent a punitive expedition against him. He was captured and died a prisoner of the Caliph in 917 or 918 CE."

 yazd.0035.t:0 "Reflections"
 yazd.0035.desc:0 "As I stand near a fire, I reflect how Sadeh is usually about fifty days before Nowruz, the new year. I can’t wait for the new year to begin, of course, but it seems so far away! The night is cold, and who knows what the next springtime will bring?"
 yazd.0035.a:0 "I huddle closer to the fire."
 yazd.0036.t:0 "The Legend of Hushang"
 yazd.0036.desc:0 "There are many conflicting stories about when Sadeh first came about. One story I’ve heard is that it was celebrated after an incident when the ancient hero of Iranian myth, Hushang, was fighting a dragon. He tried to throw a stone at it, but he missed; however, the stone struck another stone, and as both happened to be flint, this started a fire.\n\nHushang recognized that this was the doing of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], who revealed to him the secret of fire, and he wanted to celebrate this momentous occasion. Thus, Sadeh was born."
 yazd.0036.a:0 "I’m unsure if it happened like that, but it’s a nice story."
 yazd.0036.b:0 "I believe the legend tells something of the truth."
 yazd.0037.t:0 "Sadeh Poetry"
 yazd.0037.desc:0 "As the coldest night of the winter, Sadeh has often inspired many people to compose poems to describe the glory of fire. I have just listened to three commoners recite their Sadeh inspired poetry.\n\nOne poem compares a bonfire to an exquisite flower, or tree, or an entire garden blossoming in a winter landscape. The second poem describes the occasion as a conflict between the forces of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]. The last poem retells the origins of Sadeh as celebrations of how mythological Iranian heroes of ancient times, like Hushang, slew fearsome monsters like dragons.\n\nWhich one do I think is the best?"
 yazd.0037.a:0 "The lovely poem about fire and nature"
 yazd.0037.b:0 "The pious poem about good versus evil"
 yazd.0037.c:0 "The epic poem about valiant, old heroes"
 yazd.0038.t:0 "Sadeh Feast"
 yazd.0038.desc:0 "Sadeh is often time for a lot of feasting. It is the coldest time of year, after all, so besides the bonfires, food and eating together with others is also a great way to keep warm. This year’s Sadeh feast is particularly scrumptious, with delicacies such as roasted lamb and beef to enjoy."
 yazd.0038.a:0 "Tasty!"
 yazd.0039.t:0 "Giving to the Needy"
 yazd.0039.desc:0 "During Sadeh, it is customary that we give food to the less fortunate in the evening, before the bonfires are lit. Of course, I did such a thing to help those who were needy and hungry this year…."
 yazd.0039.a:0 "Sort of…. I only gave a little as a courtesy."
 yazd.0039.b:0 "I gave a respectable amount of alms to them."
 yazd.0039.c:0 "I was very generous, giving out a lot of food."
 yazd.0040.t:0 "A Fiery Spectacle"
 yazd.0040.desc:0 "These days, many kings and lords across the Iranian plateau have practiced the custom of lighting birds and animals on fire during Sadeh. That is, these wild beasts would be driven into the fire, and the spectators would eat and drink and be merry as they observe the commotion (preferably from a safe distance).\n\nPious scholars and holy people of all religions - including that of Islam #italic and#! Zoroastrianism - have condemned the practice as cruel and contrary to their faiths’ teachings. However… it #italic could#! be a lot of fun, if we did it. Should I order such a spectacle to be carried out this year?"
 yazd.0040.a:0 "If the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] say it's cruel and against [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings, then let’s not."
 yazd.0040.b:0 "Come now, why can’t we have some fun? Let’s see some animals burn!"
 yazd.0040.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! During the medieval period, sources such as the great 11th century Iranian scholar, al-Biruni, mention how animals were essentially lit on fire as part of the Sadeh celebrations. Some like al-Biruni condemned it as cruel and un-Islamic, and his Zoroastrian counterparts seem to share his viewpoint. Still, it appears to have been a popular custom among the Iranian kings of the era. It is possible this practice was not only pre-Islamic, but of non-Zoroastrian origin as well, though if so its original purpose is unknown."
 yazd.0041.t:0 "Dancing"
 yazd.0041.desc:0 "During Sadeh, we light huge bonfires to ward off the evil cold. But we don’t just stand there admiring the glorious flames - we also dance! We all join together in big circles around the fires and dance away."
 yazd.0041.a:0 "Of course, I join in with the dancing too - why wouldn’t I?"
 yazd.0041.b:0 "I decide to sit back and enjoy everyone having a good time."
 yazd.0042.t:0 "Chak-Chak"
 yazd.0042.desc:0 "Instead of celebrating Sadeh in town amidst the big bonfires like many do, I have the opportunity to do something more spiritually fulfilling during this important celebration. As is custom in the area around [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier], I am going to the cave of Chak-Chak to observe Sadeh there.\n\nAt least the trek isn’t the worst out there. Even though we have to cross a part of the desert to get there, it is only about a day’s journey.\n\nSeeing the cliffs of Chak-Chak come into view is a welcome sight for sore eyes, though it is custom that once one sees the temple there, one must continue the journey by foot. In addition, it seems the local villagers have already prepared for Sadeh."
 yazd.0042.a:0 "Time to finish the trip by foot."
 yazd.0043.t:0 "Holy Waters"
 yazd.0043.desc:0 "While celebrating Sadeh at Chak-Chak, many worshippers take the opportunity to drink water from the every-dripping holy spring there. Legend has it the spring formed from the tears the mountain shed to remember the Sassanid princess, Nikbanou."
 yazd.0043.a:0 "It is a blessing to sip these waters."
 yazd.0044.t:0 "Nikbanou's Cane"
 yazd.0044.desc:0 "Near the holy spring of Chak-Chak, there is an ancient tree, said to have grown from the cane of Nikbanou. It is an impressive and majestic sight, and one that invokes much awe."
 yazd.0044.a:0 "To think that it is still standing here after all these years."
 yazd.0045.t:0 "The Eternal Fire"
 yazd.0045.desc:0 "The fire inside the cave of Chak-Chak has been burning for ages, and a testament to not only its holiness, and the glory of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], but also to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and other laypeople who work hard day and night to ensure it keeps burning. During Sadeh, special ceremonies are held around it, such as what is happening right now."
 yazd.0045.a:0 "It is because of them I can see the fire burning here, during Sadeh."
 yazd.0046.t:0 "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds"
 yazd.0046.desc:0 "As I stand by the eternal fire in Chak-Chak, taking part in the Sadeh ceremonies, I remember the true essence of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith: good thoughts, good words and good deeds. So long as we all practice that, righteousness, justice, and happiness will always be present in this world, just as how the fire before me will always burn brightly."
 yazd.0046.a:0 "I must remember this."
 yazd.0047.t:0 "Donations"
 yazd.0047.desc:0 "During my visit to the temple in the cave of Chak-Chak, I notice the trays set aside to receive donations from pilgrims and visitors like myself. These are needed to help the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] maintain this holy shrine in these uncertain times. Perhaps I should donate some while I’m here?"
 yazd.0047.a:0 "I already help the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] throughout the year - why give more?"
 yazd.0047.b:0 "Yes, I believe a modest offering of a few coins should suffice for this."
 yazd.0047.c:0 "It would do for me to provide a decent donation of gold to this site."
 yazd.0047.d:0 "Glory to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]! I will give a great donation."

 yazd.0050.t:0 "Ancient Treasures of Yazd"
 yazd.0050.desc:0 "Legends about lost treasure abound in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier], and they have circulated in the region for generations. If these stories are to be believed, the treasures were buried or hidden by ancient Iranian dynasties over the centuries.\n\nOf course, rarely has any such discovery surfaced and been verified by reputable people. For example, recently I was told of the discovery of one such treasure within my territories in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier]. It turned out to be a misleading report."
 yazd.0050.a:0 "Perhaps one day we shall find one of these fabled lost treasures."
 yazd.0050.b:0 "This silly folklore is a waste of time, but people keep believing it!"
 yazd.0051.t:0 "Qanat Contracts"
 yazd.0051.desc:0 "The qanat makers of [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] have been famed for their abilities in qanat making for many years now, and they are regarded as some of the best in the Iranian world. Lately, a significant number of them have won contracts to build qanats in other parts of the region. This will only increase their renown further."
 yazd.0051.a:0 "I am happy for their success."
 yazd.0052.t:0 "Scholars and Gardens"
 yazd.0052.desc:0 "As [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] continues to grow and attract more learned and educated people to settle in it, many of them are praising the beauty of the city’s gardens. Many of the most notable gardens were built in honor of past notables who lived there and donated the funds needed to build them.\n\nToday, I visited one of these gardens to meet with some local scholars, as I sometimes do. While we relaxed there, we had a pleasant chat about various matters."
 yazd.0052.a:0 "These scholars provided me with very illuminating counsel!"
 yazd.0052.b:0 "It’s a boring but necessary formality to maintain my status."
 yazd.0052.c:0 "The wisdom I learn from them brings me closer to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 yazd.0053.t:0 "Replacing a Temple?"
 yazd.0053.desc:0 "[yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] was once a center of Zoroastrian worship, so there are many temples in the city that the Zoroastrian community still makes use of. However, the numbers of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] have continued to swell in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] under my leadership, and some of them have requested that I fund the construction of a new [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship].\n\nIn the past, there have been occasions when we’ve replaced a Zoroastrian temple in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] with a new [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship], in order to serve the spiritual needs of the expanding [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] community. I am considering ordering such a thing to be done right now, but doing so may upset the local Zoroastrians, who we have a tense but working relationship with."
 yazd.0053.a:0 "Tear down the old temple to build a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship], as is our right."
 yazd.0053.b:0 "We have enough [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorshipPlural]; we need to get along with our neighbors."
 yazd.0054.t:0 "A New Building?"
 yazd.0054.desc:0 "As the famed #italic Abode of Worship#!, [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] is renowned for the piety of its inhabitants no matter their religion, and regardless of whether such a reputation is true is not. Many elites who live in the city or have connections to it, such as myself, often find opportunities to patronize the building of different holy structures there.\n\nAt any rate, I currently have one such opportunity at hand. There is an empty part of town that could be the site of a lovely building that could serve the needs of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] community. It won’t be a huge building, by any means, and it would probably be somewhat humble, but if I were to donate some funds for its construction, it could reflect well on me."
 yazd.0054.a:0 "Build a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] there for locals to worship and pray in."
 yazd.0054.b:0 "Build a school there so younger generations can learn from the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText]."
 yazd.0054.c:0 "Build a mausoleum in memory of a popular [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to inspire locals."
 yazd.0054.d:0 "I am not interested in sponsoring construction projects right now."
 yazd.0055.t:0 "Yazdi Silk"
 yazd.0055.desc:0 "[yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] has, for a long time, been one of the regional centers of silk production in Iran. Though this silk, called #italic yazdi#!, cannot compete in quality with Chinese silk, it still fetches a decent price and is one of the city’s more popular exports.\n\nRecently, it has become even more popular, perhaps due to various changes in the economy or increased demand elsewhere. At any rate, it is bringing the city’s merchants even greater profits."
 yazd.0055.a:0 "Good! Good to hear!"
 yazd.0056.t:0 "Sarv-e Abarkuh"
 yazd.0056.desc:0 "Today I am paying a visit to [abarquh_barony.GetNameNoTier] which is not too far from [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier]. One landmark of note that I pass by is the #italic Sarv-e Abarkuh#!, or the Cypress of Abarkuh. The tree is very old and majestic, and local Zoroastrians claim the tree was planted by Zoroaster himself eons ago."
 yazd.0056.a:0 "I doubt Zoroaster planted it himself, but it is a nice tree."
 yazd.0056.b:0 "Though I am a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], I feel awe seeing the tree, too."
 yazd.0056.c:0 "It is a privilege to see such an ancient tree! I'll relax for a while."
 yazd.0056.d:0 "As a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], I don’t care too much about it."
 yazd.0056.e:0 "This is a sacred site. I should pray here for a bit while I’m here."
 yazd.0057.t:0 "Jewel of the Desert"
 yazd.0057.desc:0 "I am hosting an important dignitary in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] and showing him the wonders of the city. One thing he seems most impressed by is the great number of qanat waterways and windcatchers in the city.\n\n“Verily, [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] is a jewel of the desert,” the man remarks, “as it has such wonderful amenities.”"
 yazd.0057.a:0 "I couldn’t agree more with you. It’s a truly lovely place!"
 yazd.0057.b:0 "It wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of the locals. "
 yazd.0058.t:0 "Baklava of Yazd"
 yazd.0058.desc:0 "For centuries, [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] has been known for making some of the best baklava in all of Iran. I just had the opportunity to get my hands on some, which was given to me as a gift by some locals under my rule. The baklava made in Iran is a little lighter than baklava from other lands, and a unique aspect of it is how its syrup is strongly flavored by rose water and cardamom."
 yazd.0058.a:0 "Delicious baklava… so, so delicious."
 yazd.0059.t:0 "Desert Trip"
 yazd.0059.desc:0 "Today I needed to make a quick trip to a village not too far from [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier]. The trek home, however, was a little rough - [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] lies in between two deserts, the #italic Dasht-e Kavir#! and the #italic Dasht-e Lut#!, so the wilderness surrounding the settlement is often a scorching, arid place. Sweating and tired, I am so relieved when I finally enter the city! The gardens, qanats, and windcatchers of [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] make it feel like such a rejuvenating paradise after a long day of walking in the desert."
 yazd.0059.a:0 "I am glad I made it!"

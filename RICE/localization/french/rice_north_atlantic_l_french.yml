It can be interacted with once a [ruler|E] who is [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_vinland$.\n\nDue to its remoteness and the lack of lucrative resources (unlike in [greenland|E]), colonizing Vinland is extremely difficult if the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] has not been resolved with a good ending.

 north_atlantic.0090.info:0 "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! There is clear genetic, historical, and literary evidence that modern-day Icelanders have a significant amount of Gaelic ancestry. Roughly more than 50% of the women and at least 20% of the men involved in the initial settlement of Iceland may have been of Gaelic origin, and while many were probably slaves or servants, it is not implausible that a sizeable minority of them came as free men and women. Given the Norse raided and enslaved many all over Europe, it is possible people from other regions of Europe were part of the initial settlement of Iceland as well.\n\nA famous case of potential Gaelic ancestry would be Leif Erikson, who may have been distantly descended from Irish nobility. Another famous case is that of Melkorka, a supposed Irish princess who was taken as a concubine by an Icelandic chieftain. Her son, Olaf the Peacock, purportedly traveled to Ireland and was offered the throne by his grandfather, before going on various adventures.\n\nMany of these Gaelic men and women were assimilated (probably forcibly, in many cases) into Norse society, and it is likely that later Icelanders hid their Gaelic ancestry, if they had any, due to the shame of potentially being descended from lowly slaves. Still, they may have influenced Icelandic history and culture in more ways than one. For instance, they may have contributed to the early presence of Christianity in Iceland. Additionally, there is evidence that the Sagas, which are typically associated with the pagan Vikings despite being compiled by Christian Icelanders, may have borrowed ideas, motifs, and plotlines from Irish mythology and literature, even if none of the characters or deities are Gaelic per se."

However, in [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_iceland').GetName], it is considered rude to serve them to esteemed guests, especially if one has better food to offer.\n\n[milkdrinker.GetTitledFirstName], unfortunately, has a bad habit of serving [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] guests such products. [milkdrinker.GetSheHe|U] thus has a reputation for showing poor hospitality to [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] guests.\n\nRecently, when I paid [milkdrinker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] an informal visit, [milkdrinker.GetSheHe] only gave me some #italic skyr#!, Iceland’s style of yogurt! [milkdrinker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] claimed since it was not meal time, there was no need to serve a large meal. #italic Skyr#! is a rather delicious blend of creamy, sour and sweet flavors, true, but this is still an insult to a self-respecting [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like myself. I can't just ignore this!"
 north_atlantic.0208.a:0 "I like yogurt, though, so I’ll ignore the slight this time."
 north_atlantic.0208.b:0 "Scandalous! How dare [milkdrinker.GetSheHe]! I’ll insult [milkdrinker.GetHerHim] back!"
 north_atlantic.0208.c:0 "Perhaps I can convince [milkdrinker.GetHerHim] to change [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] ways."

 north_atlantic.0208.info:0 "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! Dairy products have been consumed in Northern and Western Europe for centuries, and #italic skyr#! is the name of the Icelandic variant of yogurt. Interestingly, in the Icelandic sagas, serving items like milk, cheese, or yogurt to guests was considered improper, particularly if other food could be provided. Being immersed in milk products could be considered especially humiliating.\n\nIn one episode of the #italic Egil's Saga#!, for instance, the protagonist Egil and his companions visit a man named Armod, who only serves them #italic skyr#!. Egil takes this as a great insult, and, in revenge, vomits the yogurt all over Armod, who in turn vomits back at Egil. When Armod's men ask why Egil did such a thing, he says, "Don’t blame me for following the master of the house’s example. He’s spewing his guts out just as much as I am.""

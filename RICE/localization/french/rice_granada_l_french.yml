Oddly, this story does not appear in historical sources until centuries after the massacre. Thus, even if he did write the poem, it is unlikely it was the true cause of the pogrom, as anti-Semitism had likely been rising for years in Granada.\n\nEither way, the massacre began on December 30 when a rumor spread that Joseph had killed Granada's king, Badis, to betray the kingdom to their rival, Almeria.

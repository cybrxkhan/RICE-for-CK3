 north_african_religion_desc:0 "Traditional Guanche beliefs follow the Cult of the Dead, and believe that when one passes from this world, one becomes deified among one's own family. Stone worship and construction of Megaliths bring followers closer to the Gods, with chief deities second only to the Creator being the Sun and Moon Gods."

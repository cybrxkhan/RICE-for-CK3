 guanche.0050.t:0 "Introducing Sugarcane to Madeira"
 guanche.0050.desc:0 "It is remarkable that no one has yet established a sugarcane industry here on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] despite the island’s excellent geography and abundant timber. Now, using my various connections, I have found a number of merchants operating in the Mediterranean who are willing to fund the introduction of sugarcane to the island. With enough slave labor as well as investment from merchants, this is the start of something wonderful on Madeira\n\nThere are some who believe with proper management, we can even eclipse the traditional sugarcane production centers like Sicily, Cyprus, and Andalusian within a generation or two. I say that’s an unrealistic prediction, but I admire such optimism; that would be too good to be true, and if such a thing could happen, there surely would be some kind of catch."
 guanche.0050.a:0 "Nonetheless, we’ll likely make plenty of profit."
 guanche.0051.t:0 "Introducing Sugarcane to Madeira"
 guanche.0051.desc:0 "[madeira_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has taken the initiative to introduce sugarcane to [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier]; the island’s abundant timber will undoubtedly fuel the burgeoning sugar industry here. Working together with merchants from the Mediterranean who wish to bypass their business rivals elsewhere, [madeira_ruler.GetFirstName] is not only bringing in sugar itself, but also slaves to work the fields and advisors from places as far as Sicily and beyond to oversee the construction of sugarmills and more. There are some who think the island might even surpass the traditional sugarcane production centers like Sicily, Cyprus, and Andalusia one day."
 guanche.0051.a:0 "Endless sugar…. It sounds too good to be true!"
 guanche.0052.t:0 "Madeira's Sugar Industry Collapses"
 guanche.0052.desc:0 "We should have acted, but it’s too late now. The rapidly diminishing supplies of timber on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] were the warning signs we ignored. It’s hard to imagine how Madeira, the island of endless timber, would one day no longer have enough timber to sustain its sugar industry, but that day has come.\n\nMerchants who own and operate Madeira’s once sprawling sugarcane farms and industrious sugar mills have told me that sugar production is at an all-time low due to the sudden lack of locally available timber, and the island’s sugar industry is quickly collapsing. While the sugar industry here may recover one day, it will have to rely on exported timber and will never reach its once glorious heights."
 guanche.0052.a:0 "This is not good for our economy."
 guanche.0053.t:0 "Madeira's Sugar Industry Collapses"
 guanche.0053.desc:0 "For decades, the amount of sugar produced on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] was the envy of the known world. Much of this was due in part to the vast amounts of timber found on the island that fueled this sugar industry. The once great sugar production centers like Cyprus, Andalusia, and Sicily paled in comparison to the profits coming into Madeira. Alas, all good things have to come to an end.\n\nYears of unabated, unsustainable timber harvesting have caused massive deforestation on Madeira, and many of the sugarcane farms and sugar mills on the island are closing shop - there simply isn’t enough local timber around to use anymore. While the sugar industry here may recover one day, it will never reach its once glorious heights."
 guanche.0053.a:0 "Where will the center of sugar production now shift?"

 guanche.0055.t:0 "Sugarcane Comes to the Canary Islands"
 guanche.0055.desc:0 "Ever since sugarcane was first introduced to [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier], enterprising merchants from the Mediterranean and Western Europe have also considered investing in bringing sugar to the Canary Islands. Recently, their plans have come to fruition.\n\nWorking together with local elites, these merchants are starting to establish local sugarcane plantations in [canarias_county.GetNameNoTier] and [fuerteventura_county.GetNameNoTier]. They have brought in specialists from Madeira and elsewhere to oversee the process, and slaves from much of Africa to toil away in squalid conditions to produce sugar.\n\nThe sugar mills in the Canary Islands are not expected to produce as much as in Madeira, but it should still be fairly profitable."
 guanche.0055.a:0 "The islands’ economy will certainly benefit from this."

 guanche.0060.desc:0 "There have been reports of a #italic tibicena#! living in a cave not too far from here. These demons of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] folklore are said to look like black dogs with long hair and red eyes, and prey on livestock and even people. At any rate, recently a number of livestock have been mysteriously killed, and many locals believe these terrible demons are the cause."
 guanche.0060.a:0 "Pray to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] to deliver us from these evils!"
 guanche.0060.b:0 "It's probably just bandits. Put local militia on alert."
 guanche.0061.t:0 "Meeting at the Tagoror"
 guanche.0061.desc:0 "I have gathered some local notables to meet at the nearby #italic tagoror#!, a traditional [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] circle of stones often used as meeting places. I wanted to discuss various matters with local notables today. We are all seated on our various stones and talk at length, and the meeting is well under way."
 guanche.0061.a:0 "This meeting is boring, so I’ll just daydream about something."
 guanche.0061.b:0 "There are many local disputes I wish to resolve to maintain the peace."
 guanche.0061.c:0 "I listen closely to suggestions the others make about ruling this land."
 guanche.0062.t:0 "Whistling Language"
 guanche.0062.desc:0 "Recently, a couple new whistlers have come to my employ. Traditionally, these people - skilled in the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] whistling language - to communicate information across the mountains and valleys of our homelands. This method is used to disseminate important public announcements.\n\nMy new whistlers, at any rate, are quite talented and able to produce louder whistling than my previous ones, which should help me with managing my local affairs."
 guanche.0062.a:0 "Music to my ears!"
 guanche.0063.t:0 "Shepherd's Leap"
 guanche.0063.desc:0 "Today I am spectating a competition of leaping by local [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] shepherds. The Canary Islands, where the Guanche originate from, are rugged in many parts, so shepherds there have traditionally used long wooden poles to vault themselves across ravines or down steep terrain. Over the centuries, a number of acrobatic techniques have been developed for practitioners to swiftly move across these spaces, seemingly with little effort, and the so-called #italic Shepherd's Leap#! has become something of a local sport."
 guanche.0063.a:0 "A spectacular sight to behold!"
 guanche.0063.b:0 "To encourage the contestants, I will give the victor a grand prize."
 guanche.0063.c:0 "I participated in the competitions myself - what exercise!"
 guanche.0064.t:0 "A Simple Necklace"
 guanche.0064.desc:0 "Traditionally, we [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] have found ways to craft the most beautiful ornaments from the simplest of materials like wood, bones, and shells. Today, several locals presented me with a lovely necklace made from such materials."
 guanche.0064.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but it’s a welcome gift!"
 guanche.0065.t:0 "Fire Offering"
 guanche.0065.desc:0 "I recently made an offering by burning vegetables at a local altar on a tall hill, in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner. The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] I brought along to interpret the meaning of the smoke that arose from this offering told me that it seems like [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] are pleased with this offering."
 guanche.0065.a:0 "So it seems I am blessed, then?"
 guanche.0066.t:0 "Fire Offering"
 guanche.0066.desc:0 "I recently made an offering by burning vegetables at a local altar on a tall hill, in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner. The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] I brought along to interpret the meaning of the smoke that arose from this offering told me that it seems like [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] seemed not only uninterested in the offering, but insulted!"
 guanche.0066.a:0 "Surely this is just a misreading?"
 guanche.0067.t:0 "The Lithophone"
 guanche.0067.desc:0 "On my way to take care of business in my realm, I pass by a lithophone used in some of the local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] ceremonies. These rocks produce musical sounds that are pleasing to the ear, and, more importantly, pleasing to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm], hence their usage in ceremonies. One of the guards in my entourage, familiar with the area, tells me that even witches and foul spirits are fearful of this stone, and local legend has it that striking it can deter these dangerous beings from getting too near oneself to cause harm."
 guanche.0067.a:0 "I have heard about such marvelous tales."
 guanche.0067.b:0 "It sounds like a silly superstition to me."
 guanche.0068.t:0 "The Mummy"
 guanche.0068.desc:0 "While traveling out and about in the nearby hills, some locals came across an old mummy embalmed and buried in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, inside a cave. It is a rather meager cave though, and not one well suited for such an important figure. Anyways, the commoners who found the mummy aren't sure what to do with it, and have come to me for guidance."
 guanche.0068.a:0 "Let the dead lie where they are - do not disturb it."
 guanche.0068.b:0 "We should find a better resting site for this mummy."

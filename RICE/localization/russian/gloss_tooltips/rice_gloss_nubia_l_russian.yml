 LORD_OF_THE_MOUNTAIN_GLOSS: "The #bold Lord of the Mountain#! (#italic Migin Soñoj#! in medieval Nubian) or #bold Eparch of Nobatia#! was arguably the highest-ranking official in Makuria, the northern kingdom of medieval Nubia. His chief responsibility was managing the frontier between Nubia and Egypt, and carrying out the provisions of the Baqt treaty on the Nubian side as the counterpart of the Egyptian Governor of Aswan. Currently, scholars are unsure whether the office was hereditary, appointed, or a combination of both, and whether the Eparchs had any connections with the rulers of the earlier kingdom of Nobatia that was absorbed into Makuria at some point by the 7th century."
 GOVERNOR_OF_ASWAN_GLOSS: "Historically, in medieval Egypt, the #bold Governors of Aswan#! had a major responsibility in managing the frontier between Nubia and Egypt, and carrying out the provisions of the Baqt treaty on the Egyptian side, as the counterpart of the Nubian Eparch of Nobatia."
 PHARAOH_GLOSS: "The term #bold Pharaoh#! originally referred to Ancient Egypt's royal palace, but during the New Kingdom (c. 16th-11th centuries BCE), the word came to be metonymically used to refer to the rulers of Egypt. It was never used as a formal title for Egypt's monarchs, and such usage derives from the Hebrew Bible. In reality, the Pharaohs were typically given five names by the Middle Kingdom: the Horus name, Nebty name, Golden Horus name, nomen, and prenomen."
 QORE_GLOSS: "#bold Qore#! or #bold Kore#! was the title of the rulers of the Kingdom of Kush, in ancient Nubia, particularly during the Meroitic period (542 BCE - c. 350 CE) when the capital of Kush was at Meroe. The title could be held by both male and female rulers."
 KANDAKE_GLOSS: "#bold Kandake#! or #bold Candace#! was the title of the queen mothers or queen regnants of the Kingdom of Kush, in ancient Nubia, particularly during the Meroitic period (542 BCE - c. 350 CE) when the capital of Kush was at Meroe. The term survived in the Bible to refer to a queen of the so-called Aethiopians, and survives nowadays as a common name in the West."
 HAFIR_GLOSS: "#bold Hafirs#! are a kind of artificially constructed water reservoir first built by the Kingdom of Kush in ancient Nubia, that are still used to this day. Many of the earlier hafirs were built next to Kushite temples, and may have been associated with religious and royal authority and power."
 ARCHANGEL_RAPHAEL_GLOSS: "#bold Raphael#! is one of the most esteemed archangels in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Originally mentioned in the #itailc Book of Tobit#! and the #italic Book of Enoch#!, Raphael is unnamed in the New Testament and Quran. However, later Christian tradition identified him with healing, and in Islam, he is believed to be the unnamed angel who stands eternally with a trumpet to his lips, ready to announce the Day of Judgment."
 XENODOCHIUM_GLOSS: "A #bold Xenodochium#! or #bold Xenodocheion#! (plural #italic xenoocheia#!) was a hostel for travelers, particularly pilgrims, in the medieval period. The term, originating from Greek, is used for such hostels originating from the Byzantine Empire or Christian regions influenced by it like Nubia."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_ASHITINAME_OF_MUHAMMAD: "The #bold Ashitiname of Muhammad#!, also known as the Convenant or Testament of Muhammad, is a charter granting protection and other privileges to the Christian monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai. The original version of the document was supposedly seized by the Ottomans for safekeeping when they conquered Egypt, though a copy was made to the monks of Saint Catherine's Monastery as compensation, and the Ottomans nonetheless upheld the charter's provisions."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_BEDOUIN_GUARDS: "The Christian Monastery of Saint Catherine in the Sinai has historically relied on #bold Bedouin guards#! for protection. Over the centuries, while the monastery was often raided and pillaged by Muslim forces, some of the monastery's fiercest guardians were also Muslim as well."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_BURNING_BUSH: "The #bold Burning Bush#! was, in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim tradition, the location in the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses was appointed by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. During Late Antiquity, the famed Monastery of Saint Catherine was built around a bush that is purportedly the same as the Biblical burning bush."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_LIBRARY: "The #bold library#! of Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai was built during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian, sometime between 527 and 565 CE, and is recognized as one of the world's oldest continuously operating libraries. Over the centuries, it accumulated a vast collection of manuscripts and books in a variety of languages, including but not limited to Greek, Aramaic, Syriac, Latin, Arabic, Armenian, Ge'ez, Church Slavonic, Georgian, Hebrew, and Coptic."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_PATH_OF_MOSES: "Next to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai is a route known as the #bold Path of Moses#!, that goes up a mountain where it is believed that the Biblical Moses received the Ten Commandments."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_RELICS: "Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai is associated with Saint Catherine because her purported #bold relics#! were discovered close to the monastery and brought there for safekeeping, turning it into a popular pilgrimage site as a result. In traditional hagiography, she was a young scholarly woman who converted many to Christianity, before being martyred around 305 CE."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_WELL_OF_MOSES: "Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai encloses the purported #bold Well of Moses#!, where the Biblical Moses is said to have met his future wife, Zipporah, the daughter of the Jethro, the priest and prince of Midian. Even into the modern day, the well is the monastery's main source of water."
 SAQIA_GLOSS: "#bold Saqia#! (also spelled #bold Saqiya#! or #bold Sakia#!) is a mechanical water lifting device that consists of buckets or jars fastened to a vertical wheel or a rope belt about the wheel, which in turn is attached by a shaft to a horizontal wheel turned by horses, oxen, or donkeys. This form of irrigation has been in use in the Middle East, India, and North Africa for centuries."
 TEBELDI_TREES_GLOSS: "#bold Tebeldi#! is the name used in parts of Sudan to refer to #italic Adansonia digitata#!, the most widespread species of baobab trees, which are native to much of Africa and parts of Yemen and Oman. Traditionally, it was valued as a source of food, water, and medicine. In Darfur, local rulers had a sacred obligation to protect these trees, as they were considered a crucial source of water, since the trees are useful for water storage."
 NOTARIOS_GLOSS: "In ancient Rome and Byzantium, #bold notarios#! was typically a title given to low-ranking officials or scribes with clerical or secretarial duties.

 SHOUNG_GLOSS: "The #bold Keeper of Granaries#!, or #bold Shoung#! in medieval Nubian, was a title attested for some high-ranking Makurian officials in medieval Nubia. Scholars are unsure about the duties or functions associated with the title, or if it was a ceremonial one. Curiously, one Makurian king from the late 12th century, Basil, is attested as holding this title, while he was #italic also#! king, unlike other holders of this title who were non-royal officials."

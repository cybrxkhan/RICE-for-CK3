 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_name: "Guardians of the Diamond Throne"
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_desc: "[title.GetNameNoTier] is the place where Lord Buddha gained enlightnement, known as the Diamond Throne. Worried about the decline of [religion.GetName] in the region, [guardian.GetName] took on the mantle of the #italic Pithipati#!, Lord of the Diamond Throne, to protect that very throne in the name of the [religion.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] community."
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_chapter_opening_new_title: "The wise and faithful know of the life of Lord Buddha: how he was born a prince among the Shakya clan; how he saw the four sights – old age, disease, death, and an ascetic – that spurred him to renounce a life of luxury and begin his spiritual journey; and how he gained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree. For centuries, [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'religion' ).Religion.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] pilgrims have traveled to the site of this tree to venerate the Buddha." 
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], like all followers of the Buddha, understood the importance of this tree. However, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] felt great sorrow in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] heart knowing that the current age was one of great suffering and degeneration. With the Three Jewels of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha under threat, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would soon learn that it was [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] karma to become the great protector of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'religion' ).Religion.GetNameNoTooltip] of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] life, by becoming the Lord of the Diamond Throne, the #italic Pithipati#!."
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "Yet a title is but a title; it is one thing to aspire to do good and holy deeds, it is another to actually do it. Thusly, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] took [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] new responsibilities as the #italic Pithipati#! seriously. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] sponsored artists and laborers to maintain the religious sites around the Bodhi Tree, and did much to encourage pilgrims to come visit it. Of course, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] also defended the location against all manner of threats, from bloodthirsty foreign attackers, to vile demons who, through dark magic and seductive words of manipulation, sought to tempt people from the ideals of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'religion' ).Religion.GetNameNoTooltip] and cause themselves to accumulate much negative karma."
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_chapter_extra_deed_new_title: "Righteous rulers near and far heard of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] devotion to the Three Jewels, and sent [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHim] many fine gifts to assist [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHim] in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] noble cause. As the #italic Pithipati#!, the Lord of the Diamond Throne, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] inspired others to do greater and greater deeds to preserve the teachings of the Buddha."
 RICE_magadha_pithipati_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "The title of #italic Pithipati#! was not merely a symbolic one: it was a true and steadfast committment by [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to become not only the protector of the Diamond Throne, but of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'religion' ).Religion.GetNameNoTooltip] in general. It is said that the navel of the earth lies in [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip]. When the world is destroyed at the end of this #italic kalpa#!, [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] will be the last spot to disappear, and the first one to reappear when the world reemerges. Whatever happens in [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] in the future, all are relieved knowing that [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] descendants will be there to defend it for the rest of this #italic kalpa#!."

However, this year, I will also be doing my best to abstain from various vices. Surely it won’t be too different from normal life to cut down on excesses."

Whether I succeeded or failed, it is important that I at least tried. There is always room for improvement that I may live a more virtuous and happy life in line with the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThe end of Vassa is marked by the #italic Kathina#! Festival. Traditionally, parades and ceremonies are held to celebrate the end of the monastics’ retreat, and it is also a time for us laity to give gifts to [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to show our gratitude.

 magadha.0073.desc.lustful:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('lustful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. It’s always been that way - everywhere I go, I am tempted by the pleasures of the flesh! Ever since Vassa started, I have tried to block out such unwholesome desires, yet even the sight of a little skin will send my imagination running wild with the depraved things I #italic could#! be doing. Sure, beauty is impermanent, and pleasure fleeting, so all my craving might lead me to ruin… but it is so much fun!"
 magadha.0073.desc.greedy:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('greedy').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are clear on this matter. If I am to be a good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] I must learn to share with others, yet why should I give what belongs to #italic me#! to others, to give them what they don’t deserve? It is true that all things are impermanent - kingdoms rise and fall all the time, after all - so my possessions will be worthless to me in the grand scheme of things, yet it’s still mine… for now."
 magadha.0073.desc.sadistic:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('sadistic').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I enjoy seeing others suffer. Others might not see it as a good quality, and perhaps it isn’t, but it is just so… exhilarating. The fear, the suffering, the bloodshed. I know that Emperor Ashoka, the greatest patron of Buddhism in its history, was once a bloodthirsty, brutal man like some claim i am. Somehow he reformed. I don’t know if I want to do the same… yet I must try."
 magadha.0073.desc.callous:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('callous').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. A lot of people say I don’t care about anyone. Not that I am necessarily cruel (though perhaps I can be, I admit), but I simply am indifferent and cold to others. The Buddha taught us to be kind to all sentient beings. Yet why should I care, when everyone is miserable to begin with? What good will a little kindness do? Maybe I am too focused on myself, and need to reach out to others and be more sensitive to them."
 magadha.0073.desc.vengeful:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('vengeful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I hold grudges easily, and I like to satisfy my thirst for vengeance where possible. Why must I just sit there and suffer, and let others run free despite having wronged me? It isn’t right. Even now, during Vassa, I can’t help but seethe when I think of those fools who dared cross me, and it makes me suffer. Then again… I must have wronged many and caused others to suffer, even if unintentionally. How many people want revenge against me, too?"
 magadha.0073.desc.wrathful:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('wrathful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. Everything just irritates me so easily, as someone full of rage. Even during Vassa, I ironically am angry at the fact that I can’t control my anger! How can I ever relax, much less conquer my own vices? The [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures often describe anger like a fire that consumes all. I must learn to take a deep breath, calm myself… yet… I find it so difficult."
 magadha.0073.desc.gluttonous:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('gluttonous').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. Compared to other vices, enjoying good food and drink isn’t that bad, so why should I feel guilty about it? Restraining myself from harmless fun during Vassa is hard. But it is true what the Buddha said: craving leads to suffering. There must be a balance between indulgence and extreme asceticism, but I do not know if I’ll find this Middle Way the Buddha spoke of, even during Vassa."
 magadha.0073.desc.arrogant:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('arrogant').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I mean, who can blame me?There are many out there who simply do not appreciate me for what I do. This Vassa has been annoying, as I try to not boast about my great deeds for no good reason. Then again… perhaps excessive pride leads one to do rather foolish, reckless things. The Buddha urged caution and thoughtfulness in all things. Perhaps… I am focused too much on me, instead of the world around me."
 magadha.0073.desc.impatient:0 "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('impatient').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. For a long time, it is true my general attitude is that I want things to happen now, now, now. It’s not the worst vice in the world, but now that Vassa is well under way, I find my impatience has been getting the best of me. Why can’t my cravings for luxury go away? Why can’t my idle improper thoughts leave me alone? Maybe I need to take a deep breath, and relax, and realize the world will still continue either way."

 magadha.0078.t:0 "A Monastery Needs Help"
 magadha.0078.desc:0 "I have heard one of the local monasteries is short on supplies or food. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] can simply go out to beg for alms.\n\nHowever, during Vassa, [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are discouraged from traveling outside of monasteries, and there are strict regulations about this. Even if they have a justified reason, it is the responsibility of laity such as myself to assist them so they can focus on their spiritual practice."
 magadha.0078.a:0 "Why should I get involved?"
 magadha.0078.b:0 "Give the monastery some alms."
 magadha.0078.c:0 "Donate a lot to the monastery!"
 magadha.0079.t:0 "Listening to a Sermon"
 magadha.0079.desc:0 "Although the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are mainly focused on meditation, chanting, and other religious practices during Vassa, some will also take time to give sermons to laity such as myself when we visit to give them alms. Today, I attended one such sermon by a famous [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], who expounded on various topics related to the Buddha’s teachings. Hearing such wise and thoughtful words really helped me in my attempts to restrain from engaging in vice and indulgence."
 magadha.0079.a:0 "It is good I attended this sermon."
 magadha.0080.t:0 "Chanting"
 magadha.0080.desc:0 "Today, as part of Vassa, I am chanting various [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures to myself. It is helping me focus, certainly, so that I may be able to better improve myself spiritually."
 magadha.0080.a:0 "In the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha…"
 magadha.0081.t:0 "Can't Find Nothing"
 magadha.0081.desc:0 "One issue, if I want to call it that, during Vassa is that sometimes it isn’t always easy to buy food and drink. Just as many people try to cut down on excess indulgence during this time, even shopkeepers and merchants will cut down on how much of such indulgent products they sell. Unfortunately, I’m having difficulty buying enough of these products to serve for some upcoming functions and gatherings I’ll be hosting.\n\nNow, given I am not a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], it isn’t necessarily a problem if I want to buy some of these things (within reason), especially if it would help me with my various duties and responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. But I have agreed to abstain from vices this year, or at least reduce them, so perhaps this is an opportunity for me to put that into practice and do what I’d say I’d do…."
 magadha.0081.a:0 "As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I can’t let others see me in squalor."
 magadha.0081.b:0 "Yes, perhaps I will wait until later to buy these things."
 magadha.0082.t:0 "Wisdom and Insight"
 magadha.0082.desc:0 "Some of the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are aware of my vow to abstain from vices during this Vassa, and have commended me for setting an example to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] community, or the Sangha. One [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] in particular, has taken a great interest in providing me pointers and advice on how to manage myself and practice the teachings of the Buddha, on top of the usual responsibilities and duties such a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] would have during Vassa."

 magadha.0100.t:0 "Ancient Legends of Magadha"
 magadha.0100.desc:0 "It is said that Buddha and Mahavira, the founders of Buddhism and Jainism respectively, once frequented many parts of [magadha_duchy.GetNameNoTier] in ancient times, and there are many legends associated with them. Today, a scholar is telling me about several of the legends associated with these two figures in various territories I rule in  - the places they visited, where they preached their religions’ doctrines, who they met, and what they did there."
 magadha.0100.a:0 "To think [magadha_duchy.GetNameNoTier] is full of history like this!"
 magadha.0101.t:0 "Buddhist Pilgrims"
 magadha.0101.desc:0 "Recently, there has been an influx of Buddhist pilgrims traveling through [capital_province.GetName], given the region around [magadha_duchy.GetNameNoTier] is full of many important Buddhist sites of worship and learning. I’ve considered taking several policies to support these pilgrims, such as providing funds to build additional hostels, or encouraging merchants to come in to sell them various necessities."
 magadha.0101.a:0 "Let’s help them - it’ll be good for the economy, too!"
 magadha.0101.b:0 "I don’t have the funds to spare for a project like this."
 magadha.0101.c:0 "Why would I support these kinds of blasphemers?"
 magadha.0102.t:0 "A Trip to [rajgir_barony.GetNameNoTier]"
 magadha.0102.desc:0 "[rajgir_visitor.GetTitledFirstName] just returned from a recent trip to the springs of [rajgir_barony.GetNameNoTier], both to relax and to pray and engage in spiritual practice there, given how the springs have been venerated by generations of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural]. Overall [rajgir_visitor.GetSheHe] seemed to have a good time!"
 magadha.0102.a:0 "Welcome back!"
 magadha.0103.t:0 "Learn Our Peaceful Ways..."
 magadha.0103.desc:0 "A number of prominent Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain ascetics based near [magadha_duchy.GetNameNoTier] have recently gotten into a number of large public debates about the validity of each others’ beliefs. I only sometimes get involved, but perhaps it might be time for me to step in to ensure these… arguments don’t get out of hand and don’t disrupt public peace. For years, both groups have coexisted in the region, but there is often a lot of tension as they try to win believers to one side or another, so this isn’t anything new."
 magadha.0103.a:0 "I must support the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')]!"
 magadha.0103.b:0 "I need to be neutral to ensure everything remains orderly."
 magadha.0103.c:0 "I don’t care about the squabblings of some deluded heretics."
 magadha.0104.t:0 "The Pilgrim's Records"
 magadha.0104.desc:0 "A [xuanzang.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [xuanzang.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] named [xuanzang.GetFullName] from a foreign land is currently crossing through my territory and paying a visit to my court. [xuanzang.GetSheHe|U] intends to gather [xuanzang.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures from India to bring back home, in order to better spread the teachings of the Buddha there.\n\nBesides this, [xuanzang.GetFullName] is taking meticulous notes on the countries and kingdoms [xuanzang.GetSheHe] is passing through, in order to prepare an account and records of all [xuanzang.GetSheHe] had seen here to tell everyone back home. As such, [xuanzang.GetSheHe] has been asking me various questions about life and business here in my realm.\n\nI want to make sure I leave a glowing impression, so that [xuanzang.GetSheHe] will speak of me and my people fondly when [xuanzang.GetSheHe] returns to [xuanzang.GetHerHis] homeland and mentions me in [xuanzang.GetHerHis] records."

 magadha.0104.b:0 "The influence of our armies and administrators"
 magadha.0104.c:0 "How our land is cultured, just like [xuanzang.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] homeland"

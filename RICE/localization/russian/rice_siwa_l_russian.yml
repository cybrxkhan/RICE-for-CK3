In particular, they have been assigned to begin with the rehabilitation of the Chapel of Peace and the Chapel of the Exodus, two of the most prominent chapels at El-Bagawat. Even in their deteriorated state, I can see the simple beauty of the artwork that depicts various Biblical scenes."

After writing it down, I give it to the oracular priest, who steps in front of the statue and performs a brief ceremony, which involves a number of prayers and incantations.

It is sadly in a state of disrepair, and has been for centuries."
 siwa.0050.a:0 "One can only imagine what it was like back in the day!"

Other locals fear this is a bad idea and think occupying the mountain should be forbidden, lest the spirits of the dead be disturbed."

Recently, one of the hermits’ representatives has approached me, explaining they are short on supplies, and humbly request a small donation."

 siwa.0062.desc:0 "Many people in Dakhla Oasis, especially those who live in the village of Bashendi, often like to claim that they are descended from a certain Indian prince, known as Pasha Hindi (hence the name of village). It is said that after being exiled from his homeland in India, he traveled far and eventually settled in Dakhla, where he became a respected local leader. At a meeting today with several notables from the area, one of them claimed to be one of the senior descendants of this Pasha Hindi, though others have disputed his claim in the past. Regardless, he’s pretty proud of it and boasts about it frequently during the meeting."

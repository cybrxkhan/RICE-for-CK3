 siwa.0054.b:0 "I have my doubts - perhaps he was hallucinating due to dehydration in the desert."
 siwa.0055.t:0 "Mountain of the Dead"
 siwa.0055.desc:0 "Not too far from Siwa Oasis is the so-called Gebel al-Mawta, or the Mountain of the Dead. This conical shaped mountain is said to have been the central necropolis of the ancient Siwans, back when the Pharaohs and Romans ruled this land, for it contains many man-made caves that are often discovered to house mummies and other burial goods.\n\nLately, a number of Siwan families, attracted by the large open spaces of the caves, have started moving in to make their homes. Other locals fear this is a bad idea and think occupying the mountain should be forbidden, lest the spirits of the dead be disturbed."
 siwa.0055.a:0 "Let the locals decide among themselves - it’s not my concern."
 siwa.0055.b:0 "Those people can move in. Why fear those who are already dead?"
 siwa.0055.c:0 "Those are justified concerns. Forbid anyone from moving in."
 siwa.0056.t:0 "Hermits of Kharga"
 siwa.0056.desc:0 "For centuries, Kharga Oasis has been a refuge for Christian hermits, whether to escape the temptations of ordinary life or flee religious persecution. They often live in the rugged hills and caves some distance from Kharga, and spend most of the day praying and engaging in other religious practices.\n\nWhether Christian or not, Kharga’s rulers have tolerated these hermits, as many pilgrims often come to visit them, which is good for business. Recently, one of the hermits’ representatives has approached me, explaining they are short on supplies, and humbly request a small donation."
 siwa.0056.desc.christian:0 "As a fellow Christian, he says I can show how magnanimous and devout I am, so both parties would benefit."
 siwa.0056.desc.nonchristian:0 "Though I am not Christian, he says I can show how magnanimous and tolerant I am, so both parties would benefit."
 siwa.0056.a:0 "Yes, very well - you shall have the aid you seek."
 siwa.0056.b:0 "I am sorry, I cannot afford to spare anything."
 siwa.0056.c:0 "Insolence! Banish these greedy heathens to the desert!"
 siwa.0057.t:0 "Infidel Rock"
 siwa.0057.desc:0 "Near Farafra Oasis is a large formation of several rocks. As I pass through it today, I have to concede it is a towering and majestic sight. The people who live here have called it “Infidel Rock” for many generations, and according to local lore, it is the place where the famed army of the Persian King Cambyses went before they departed on their ill-fated journey to Siwa Oasis - a journey in which none of the men returned."
 siwa.0057.a:0 "Interesting."
 siwa.0058.t:0 "Hagar al-Makhrum"
 siwa.0058.desc:0 "I had to go out into the desert near Farafra Oasis on a trip today. Coming back, I passed by a sizeable, natural stone arch at a top of a ridge. Its local name is Hagar al-Makhrum, or the Rock with a Hole."
 siwa.0058.a:0 "A majestic sight."
 siwa.0059.t:0 "Olives"
 siwa.0059.desc:0 "Olive farms are a common sight in the oases in the western desert of Egypt. While not as lucrative as olives farmed in other regions of the Mediterranean, they nevertheless bring in quite some profit. I have the opportunity to invest in some olive farms at the moment in the oases that I control. Perhaps it would be a good idea for an investment?"
 siwa.0059.a:0 "Indeed. Let’s make the necessary arrangements."
 siwa.0059.b:0 "No, I don’t think we need to do that."
 siwa.0060.t:0 "Karshef"
 siwa.0060.desc:0 "I am visiting a powerful, local elder in Siwa Oasis to discuss important matters related to the administration of the oasis. While outside it is very hot today, the moment I step inside his house, it suddenly feels so cool, as if a gentle breeze were blowing through. This can be attributed to karshef, the mixture of mud and minerals traditionally used to make houses in Siwa since ancient times, that keeps the house cool and comfortable in hot weather."
 siwa.0060.a:0 "Dear elder, it is good to see you! Now onto business…."
 siwa.0061.t:0 "Kellis"
 siwa.0061.desc:0 "While traveling through Dakhla Oasis, I pass by some abandoned ruins. My guide tells me that this was once the town known as ‘Kellis’ in Roman times, and a major site of pagan worship. Now, nothing remains but dust and stone, with some of the buildings mostly or partly buried by the sand. The locals avoid inhabiting the ruins, out of fear that they may collapse, as happens on occasion."
 siwa.0061.a:0 "A reminder of those who came before us."
 siwa.0062.t:0 "Pasha Hindi"
 siwa.0062.desc:0 "Many people in Dakhla Oasis, especially those who live in the village of Bashendi, often like to claim that they are descended from a certain Indian prince, known as Pasha Hindi (hence the name of village). It is said that after being exiled from his homeland in India, he traveled far and eventually settled in Dakhla, where he became a respected local leader. At a meeting today with several notables from the area, one of them claimed to be one of the senior descendants of this Pasha Hindi, though others have disputed his claim in the past. Regardless, he’s pretty proud of it and boasts about it frequently during the meeting."
 siwa.0062.a:0 "If he is descended from Pasha Hindi, he is right to be proud."
 siwa.0062.b:0 "These vain claims hard to substantiate - anyone can say such things!"
 siwa.0062.c:0 "What arrogance! He must show humility in front of me, his liege."
 siwa.0063.t:0 "Olives and Dates"
 siwa.0063.desc:0 "Some locals from my territories in the Western Desert have approached me with an offering of tribute of prized olives and dates from their village."
 siwa.0063.a:0 "Your gift is much appreciated."

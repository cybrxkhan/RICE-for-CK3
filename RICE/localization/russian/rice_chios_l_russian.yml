It is a pity a man revered by thinkers and storytellers across the world has no monument to his name."

 chios.0005.desc.mid:0 "\n\nThough I do not worship the pagan gods of the ancient Greeks, it is important to pay our respects to Homer, who through his wisdom and eloquence educated us all about humanity and the divine."
 chios.0005.desc.end:0 "Even a modest monument to Homer will surely attract visitors from afar who wish to pay their respects to the composer of the Iliad and Odyssey, and the man Plato himself called “the first teacher and beginner of all these beauties of tragedy.”"
 chios.0005.a:0 "It is time that we honored Homer properly."

After a lot of discussion, we narrow our potential options of what the new mastic village will be like down to three:\n\n- A fortress settlement to protect the mastic groves from bandits\n- A coastal trade port to increase profit\n- A town with good quality of life to develop the island’s infrastructure\n\nAs the Lord of Chios, I have the final say on what the village’s focus will be:"

 chios.0020.desc:0 "There are many different festivities traditionally held across the Aegean Sea, but few match the charm of the Mostra of Thymiana on the island of Chios.\n\nMany years ago, the inhabitants of Thymiana were holding a carnival when they learned that pirates were about to attack. With cunning and zeal, the townspeople ambushed the pirates and won a stunning victory. They crucified any pirates they captured in the town center, so that the whole town could bask in their glorious triumph.\n\nSince then, every spring, the town has held a celebration to remember that occasion. I, of course, intend to attend the festivities this year."
 chios.0020.a:0 "Time to set off for Thymiana!"
 chios.0021.t:0 "Thymiana"
 chios.0021.desc:0 "I have arrived in Thymiana. It is one of the larger settlements on the island of Chios, and, like many places in the Aegean, is full of picturesque beaches and charmingly rugged hills. As I go into town, I cannot help but admire the lovely buildings, made from a red-brown stone unique to the area that comes from a nearby quarry.\n\nAlready, I see many townspeople scurrying about as they prepare for the Mostra."
 chios.0021.a:0 "I can’t wait for the Mostra to begin."
 chios.0022.t:0 "The Mostra of Thymiana Begins!"
 chios.0022.desc:0 "Friday evening comes, and the Mostra of Thymiana has begun. Crowds gather in the streets of Thymiana in a jovial atmosphere. A number of young villagers are dressed in traditional clothing and wear masks, and dance around the crowds, teasing and making jokes to spread cheer to everyone."
 chios.0022.a:0 "Join the crowd in reveling!"
 chios.0022.b:0 "Sit back and enjoy the sights."
 chios.0023.t:0 "Solemn Remembrances"
 chios.0023.desc:0 "It is now Sunday, and this morning begins with everyone gathering at Thymiana’s graveyard to pray for the deceased. We must remember, after all, that this celebration could only happen thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the courageous villagers from so long ago when they defended Thymiana against the pirates."
 chios.0023.a:0 "I join the locals in prayer."
 chios.0024.t:0 "The Battle and Parade"
 chios.0024.desc:0 "Following that solemn event, we move onto the main spectacle of the Mostra - the reenactment of that battle long ago!\n\nTwo groups of locals gather in Thymiana’s town square: one dresses up in the town’s traditional garb, and represent their ancestors who fought against the pirates; the others dress to look like pirates. Accompanied by music, the two sides twirl and move around each other, face to face, in a highly stylized retelling of that fateful battle so long ago.\n\nOnce this is done, a mighty parade comes through the town, and a grand feast starts in the town square."
 chios.0024.a:0 "Everyone is having a good time."
 chios.0025.t:0 "The Mostra Ends"
 chios.0025.desc:0 "After spending a wonderful amount of time in Thymiana, the celebrations are done, for all good things must come to an end unfortunately.

It’s quite delicious!\n\n“Would you like to bring some home?” the woman asks, after seeing my good reaction. “For you, it will be no cost.”"
 chios.0030.a:0 "Of course! That sounds good to me."
 chios.0030.b:0 "No, I cannot. But thank you for the offer."
 chios.0031.t:0 "Tambouras"
 chios.0031.desc:0 "As everyone settles into eating, dancing, or chatting at the Mostra, I watch as some local musicians play and sing on the tamboura, an old style of lute common in this part of the world. The music is rustic and simple compared to what I listen to at my court, but it does have its charm."
 chios.0031.a:0 "It’s nice to listen to, definitely."
 chios.0032.t:0 "Limestone Colors"
 chios.0032.desc:0 "Deciding to take a little break from all the festivity of the Mostra, I sit in a meadow right next to town with a few acquaintances. As we discuss various topics, my gaze turns to the town of Thymiana itself, and its various assortment of buildings. I note how the buildings’ stones often have a tint of brown and red, reflecting the common color of the limestone found near Thymiana."
 chios.0032.a:0 "Oh! I should pay attention to the conversation."
 chios.0033.t:0 "Dance, Dance"
 chios.0033.desc:0 "In the midst of the Mostra’s festivities, I see a group of villagers spontaneously burst into dance, laughing in the town square as they sing and move their hands and twirl themselves around each other."
 chios.0033.a:0 "I should join them in the fun!"
 chios.0033.b:0 "I will just watch from here."
 chios.0034.t:0 "Thymiana's Story"
 chios.0034.desc:0 "At the Mostra, a group of adults and children are seated on the ground, surrounding an elder who sits on a wooden stool. The old man leans over, and with exaggerated gestures and a surprisingly powerful voice, retells in detail the story of how their ancestors, through wit and determination, drove off the pirates when they attacked Thymiana many centuries ago."
 chios.0034.a:0 "It is an interesting story."
 chios.0035.t:0 "Wooden Sword"
 chios.0035.desc:0 "During the Mostra festivities, I am talking with one of the young men who took part in the mock battle that reenacted the real one from generations ago. He proudly shows me the wooden sword he danced with during the mock battle.\n\n“My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I can show you some useful moves with this sword, if you’re interested,” he tells me."
 chios.0035.a:0 "Yes, by all means! I would love to see what you know."
 chios.0035.b:0 "Come on, that’s not a real sword! Let’s go find some food instead."
 chios.0035.c:0 "Why don’t I show you some sword moves myself? I know a thing or two."
 chios.0036.t:0 "Chian Foods"
 chios.0036.desc:0 "During the feast, I see several plates of food arrayed before me. There’s many delicious dishes to choose from, but a few catch my eye. What should I eat now?"
 chios.0036.a:0 "Avgokalamara - small omelettes filled with mince sauteed with onion"
 chios.0036.b:0 "Kakavia soup - made from a variety of fish, onions, and black pepper"
 chios.0036.c:0 "Melitzanopilafo - eggplants cut into rings, with vegetables, spices, and rice"
 chios.0037.t:0 "Chian Wine"
 chios.0037.desc:0 "“Would you like some of our wine, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]?” the peasant lady asks me, when I go back to get my next round of food. “Go ahead. We mix it with a bit of mastic, and they’re always great for joyous occasions like this carnival.”"
 chios.0037.a:0 "Thanks! I’ll take some."
 chios.0037.b:0 "No thanks!"
 chios.0038.t:0 "Thymiana's Watchtowers"
 chios.0038.desc:0 "Together with a group of villagers, I take a break from the main festivities and visit one of the old watchtowers located at the edge of Thymiana. Legend has it that this particular watchtower was the one that spotted the pirates when they first arrived before that climatic battle many years ago."
 chios.0038.a:0 "Fascinating that this old stone building still seems to stand so strong."
 chios.0039.t:0 "Masks"
 chios.0039.desc:0 "One of the villagers of Thymiana is showing me the mask he wore as part of the main ceremony for the Mostra earlier.\n\n“Quite scary, isn’t it?” he says, laughing. “When I wear it, I feel like a different person!”\n\nHe then explains to me the different kinds of masks the locals wear during the festivities, what they mean, and how they are made."
 chios.0039.a:0 "These masks can certainly frighten anyone!"
 chios.0039.b:0 "The masks aren’t scary, but they seem fun to wear."

 chios.0050.desc:0 "My guards have, together with some cooperative locals, arrested a number of traders and bandits who were involved in illegally smuggling mastic outside of Chios. As ruler of Chios, it is my right to get a portion of the profits earned from the ancient mastic trade, and all mastic trade is under my jurisdiction, so this is a grave crime."
 chios.0050.a:0 "I feel merciful today, so let them go - they know not to do it again."
 chios.0050.b:0 "Imprison them and confiscate any mastic they have."
 chios.0050.c:0 "Per ancient custom, execution is an acceptable punishment for this."
 chios.0051.t:0 "Mastic Trade Improves"
 chios.0051.desc:0 "Recently, global demand for mastic has been increasing. This should be good for me, as it means that there will be additional profits to be made from the mastic trade centered around Chios."
 chios.0051.a:0 "Very good!"
 chios.0052.t:0 "Mastic Trade Declines"
 chios.0052.desc:0 "Recently, global demand for mastic has been decreasing. This might be a problem, as it means that there will be decreased profits from the mastic trade centered around Chios."
 chios.0052.a:0 "That’s not good."
 chios.0053.t:0 "Piracy in Chios"
 chios.0053.desc:0 "Piracy has always been a problem in the Aegean, but especially in Chios due to it being a center of the mastic trade. There have been several pirate raids on the island of Chios recently, and while we managed to fight them off for the most part, it has caused some damage to our local infrastructure."
 chios.0053.a:0 "Let’s make sure those pirates don’t cause any further damage!"
 chios.0054.t:0 "Agismata"
 chios.0054.desc:0 "Today I am going on a trip to the hot springs of Agismata on Chios. As its waters are rich in various minerals, people have been coming here for centuries as a form of physical therapy and healing, and I am no different."
 chios.0054.a:0 "I definitely need a break!"
 chios.0055.t:0 "Roman Shipwreck"
 chios.0055.desc:0 "On the road to the village of Anavatos on Chios, there is a road outside the village that leads to the magnificent coast of Elinta. I am journeying along this road today, and observe the scenery. There is a deep bay with a beach full of pebbles, flanked by the deep blue sea. Nearby, according to tradition, there is a shipwreck of a Roman ship lying in the bottom."
 chios.0055.a:0 "A beautiful sight. What treasures might lie in that shipwreck?"
 chios.0056.t:0 "Emporios"
 chios.0056.desc:0 "Today I am visiting the village of Emporios on Chios. As I approach the village, I look to the nearby beach, full of little black pebbles, for which it is famous."
 chios.0056.a:0 "A lovely sight to behold!"
 chios.0057.t:0 "Pine Forest of Chios"
 chios.0057.desc:0 "I was traveling by Avgonyma on the isle of Chios, when I got lost in the pine forest near the village, the largest such forest on the island, in fact. It took me a couple of hours to find my way out, but thankfully I was unharmed."
 chios.0057.a:0 "I’ll have to be careful going through that forest next time."
 chios.0058.t:0 "Chian Labyrinth"
 chios.0058.desc:0 "While inspecting some of my territory on Chios, I visit one of the mastic villages. A village notable shows me around the defenses the locals built surrounding the village, to protect its lucrative mastic from pirate and bandit threats. The houses are arranged in such a way that they themselves form part of the wall, and the streets are designed to be like a labyrinth, winding and going in all sorts of directions that would confuse any who dared to come attack this place."
 chios.0058.a:0 "Hopefully, we’ll never need to worry about an attack."
 chios.0059.t:0 "An Artistic Village"
 chios.0059.desc:0 "I am visiting Pyrgi, a village in my domain in Chios. It is unique compared to the other villages on the island because it is tradition here for the walls of many of the buildings to be decorated in a variety of geometric designs and motifs. For many, it turns the whole place into a work of art."
 chios.0059.a:0 "Very creative! It’s good this tradition is alive."
 chios.0059.b:0 "It’s fine, but I’ve seen more impressive artwork."
 chios.0060.t:0 "Ariousian Wine"
 chios.0060.desc:0 "The village of Kourounia on Chios is famous for producing a special variety of local wine, said to be a contemporary variety of an ancient Greek wine called Ariousian Wine. Like in ancient times, wine from the island is famous and sold all over the Mediterranean, and Ariousian Wine above all.\n\nToday, a small delegation from Kourounia is paying my court a visit, and they offer me some of their famous wines. Such a nice gift could be useful when I am hosting any other guests or feasts in the future - who wouldn’t want a sip of such wine?"
 chios.0060.a:0 "Thank you - you can leave it over there."
 chios.0061.t:0 "Homer's Wine"
 chios.0061.desc:0 "For generations and generations, Chios was famous for its wine, particularly the so-called Ariousian Wine, the most famous variety of which comes from the village of Kourounia. Ancient writers even called it the nectar of the gods.\n\nBecause the great poet Homer, who composed the Illiad and Odyssey, is believed to have lived on Chios for all his life, there are even those who say that Homer’s brilliance and eloquence was due in part to his consumption of this wine. Is this claim true? If it is, perhaps it might be wise for me to make this wine a regular part of my diet."
 chios.0061.a:0 "That sounds like a silly, nonsensical idea. Wine is wine."
 chios.0061.b:0 "It wouldn’t hurt for me to try! Let’s buy some of the wine."

 chios.0062.desc:0 "Near Aghiasmata, one of the major trade ports on the island of Chios, are the antimony mines of Keramos. Antimony, which has a variety of uses ranging from medicine to cosmetics, has been a major source of income for this area, even in ancient times. Recently, there has been a boon in the antimony produced from this area."
 chios.0062.a:0 "That’s great to hear!"
 chios.0063.t:0 "Nagos Beach"
 chios.0063.desc:0 "Today, I went on a trip to the beach of Nagos on the island of Chios. It’s a scenic beach, and a good place to relax - it is flanked by rows of lovely maple trees and dense vegetation and running water springs, while the beach itself is full of gorgeous colorful pebbles."
 chios.0063.a:0 "I’m glad I came here."
 chios.0064.t:0 "Lithi"
 chios.0064.desc:0 "I am paying a visit to the village of Lithi on the coast of Chios. Its shallow beach is quite beautiful, and it is known for being a major fishing town on the island. While there, I am treated to a feast that features a huge variety of fish that the local fishermen catch."
 chios.0064.a:0 "Its reputation as a fishing town is well-deserved!"
 chios.0065.t:0 "Inspiration for Homer?"
 chios.0065.desc:0 "An acquaintance of mine in Chios took me to a cliff on the island, as she wanted to show me some of the scenery on her property. Below us was a lovely beach with blue waters, and some trees scattered about. Anyhow, she claims that according to family lore, this spot was where the ancient poet Homer would sometimes go if he needed some inspiration for his stories. It’s a happy coincidence this place happens to be on her family’s ancestral lands."
 chios.0065.a:0 "I’m sure Homer did visit here once."
 chios.0065.b:0 "We can’t really tell if Homer was ever here."
 chios.0066.t:0 "Kambos"
 chios.0066.desc:0 "The valley of Kambos on Chios is renowned for its lush fertile hills, and as a result it has attracted a number of nobles who seek to exploit its agricultural potential. The valley is, in fact, dotted with several mansions belonging to such elite families.\n\nToday, I am calling on one such lesser aristocrat, who is explaining to me how their family is making the most out of the bounty of this area."
 chios.0066.a:0 "It's useful information to know."
 chios.0067.t:0 "Lost!"
 chios.0067.desc:0 "During my inspection of one of the mastic villages, my guards and I got lost in the winding, narrow streets and confusingly placed buildings. The villages' layout is designed to confound any bandits and pirates who would come here, in order to protect the island's valuable mastic. Still, it is embarrassing!"
 chios.0067.a:0 "At least it works as intended."
 chios.0068.t:0 "Thymaina"
 chios.0068.desc:0 "I am paying a visit to Thymaina, a small islet off the coast of Samos where I rule. Though it is only meant to be a brief visit, I duly greet the elders of the small hamlet there. They present me with a gift of some thyme (which the island is named after), harvested from various places throughout the island."
 chios.0068.a:0 "A good gift, and much appreciated."
 chios.0069.t:0 "Petrokopio"
 chios.0069.desc:0 "On the island of Fourni, which lies between Samos and Ikaria, there is an ancient marble quarry site known as Petrokopio. Though not in use as much these days, every now and then the locals produce a decent amount of marble which they ship to other nearby islands. Recently, the quarry has been experiencing such a boon."
 chios.0069.a:0 "I wonder what we could use the marble for?"
 chios.0070.t:0 "Dangerous Waters"
 chios.0070.desc:0 "The waters between the islands of Samos and Ikaria are filled with many smaller islets, which means such places are dangerous for ships not experienced in these waters. Recently, I received word of one such trade ship from afar getting caught in a local storm and sinking. A number of sailors and merchants managed to survive, however, and find themselves on beaches in my territory."
 chios.0070.a:0 "I wish them the best."
 chios.0070.b:0 "They can rest at my estate."
 chios.0071.t:0 "Ruins of Kamari"
 chios.0071.desc:0 "I am visiting the island of Fourni, which lies to the west of Samos and east of Ikaria, when I pass by a part of the coast the locals call the beach of Kamari. There, beneath the azure waters, I swear I could see the ruins of a town. The locals accompanying me confirm to me that my eyes do not deceive me. There is, indeed, an ancient submerged settlement close to the beach - so close, in fact, that one could even swim near it and observe it from a closer perspective."
 chios.0071.a:0 "One can only wonder what happened to that town."
 chios.0071.b:0 "I have some time - why not swim and explore there?"
 chios.0072.t:0 "Icarus"
 chios.0072.desc:0 "I am hearing someone recount to me a myth about the island of Ikaria, which lies to the west of Samos in my territories. It is supposedly named so by the ancient Greeks as they believed it was where the legendary Icarus fell and died after flying too high and close to the sun."
 chios.0072.a:0 "True or not, Icarus' story teaches us about the dangers of pride."
 chios.0072.b:0 "Clearly some heathen claptrap - it's a ridiculous story."
 chios.0072.c:0 "An old story, wisely told by our forefathers about hubris."
 chios.0073.t:0 "Houses of Ikaria"
 chios.0073.desc:0 "I am inspecting my territory on the island of Ikaria, which lies west of Samos. For a while now, I've noticed the houses there are built in a strange fashion - they have no chimneys and low ceilings, and are made mostly of solid blocks of stone. According to the locals, such measures help protect them, as it confuses pirates who may mistake the houses for big rocks instead."
 chios.0073.a:0 "Hmm… an odd but understandable custom."
 chios.0073.b:0 "We could learn from their styles when building defenses."
 chios.0074.t:0 "Muscat Wine"
 chios.0074.desc:0 "Some notables from Samos are visiting me today to discuss some matters pertaining to their island. Before we begin business, they present me with a gift of the island's famed sweet muscat wine."
 chios.0074.a:0 "Thank you! Now, onto business…."
 chios.0075.t:0 "Beaches of Samos"
 chios.0075.desc:0 "I am traveling through Samos, specifically one of its emerald beaches. As I lift my eyes and gaze across the waters, I can see the jutting mountains and terrain of Anatolia not too far away. It's strange to think that this island is, in fact, that close to the mainland."
 chios.0075.a:0 "Such are the wonders of nature."
 chios.0076.t:0 "The Father of History"
 chios.0076.desc:0 "Though he wasn't born on the island, the famous ancient historian Herodotus is said to have lived on Samos during his youth. It is interesting to reflect on how this respected man once walked and played in the territory under my jurisdiction."
 chios.0076.a:0 "Perhaps the father of history was inspired by what he saw on Samos."
 chios.0076.b:0 "Don't they call Herodotus the father of lies? I think he's unreliable."
 chios.0077.t:0 "Psara"
 chios.0077.desc:0 "I have heard about how the residents of Psara, a desolate isle to the west of Chios, have a most rugged and harsh existence and that it has been this way for many generations if not centuries - even the ancient Greeks spoke of the island's poverty in legendary terms. For instance, there was a phrase in olden times, "Psara celebrating Dionysus, god of wine,"to signify poverty, for it was believed the inhabitants of the island were so poor they could not even afford to even have a little wine at important festivals. Apparently, not much has changed on the island since then."
 chios.0077.a:0 "Surely these stories of poverty are just embellishments."
 chios.0077.b:0 "Tragic that the island is cursed with such a long-term fate."
 chios.0077.c:0 "I would like to give some charity to assist the islanders."
 chios.0078.t:0 "Pharmakonisi"
 chios.0078.desc:0 "The tiny island of Pharmakonisi lies a little south of Samos in the Aegean Sea. Despite its seeming unimportance, it has been renowned for the many pharmaceutical herbs that grow on it, from which it derives its name. Anyways, the island is within my jurisdiction, and I’ve considered sending for some of my subordinates to get some of those famed herbs for me."
 chios.0078.a:0 "Then again, it would be a waste of time."
 chios.0078.b:0 "It would be good for my health."
 chios.0079.t:0 "Pythagoras"
 chios.0079.desc:0 "The island of Samos is in my domain, and I have recently been reflecting on one of its most famous sons, the philosopher Pythagoras. Even now, he is revered as the founder of mathematics and music. On the island, there is a cave said to have been where he fled to avoid the Samnian tyrant Polycrates and to teach others in privacy, before he went into exile to Italy. The cave is hard to reach, so few take the journey. Nonetheless, I find something awe-inspiring about the fact this man once lived here, and he has inspired me in my life as of late."
 chios.0079.a:0 "Numbers rule the universe, as he once said!"

I therefore provided the funds and resources necessary to help with this noble endeavor. The monastery, fittingly, will be called the monastery of Saint John."

I observe it all: the texture of the rock, the smell of the damp air, the hint of the breeze from outside. I reflect on how it was here that the fiery, terrifying words of the Book of Revelation were written; I take time to meditate on its words.\n\n#italic The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:#!\n#italic Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw...#!"

 rhodes.0050.desc:0 "Today I am in Kallithea, a small hamlet on [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier]. I am, in particular, paying a visit to its springs. It is said the physician Hippocrates claimed these waters had great medicinal properties."
 rhodes.0050.a:0 "Ah… relaxation is just what I needed."
 rhodes.0051.t:0 "Filerimos"
 rhodes.0051.desc:0 "I have arrived in Filerimos, a hilltop location on the island of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier] nestled between some serene, quiet pine groves.\n\nThis area has been visited by many for centuries for both its strategic location and as a place for relaxation. There is a tiny [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] here, as well as a small but mighty little fort, and several villas where many of the local aristocrats come to unwind under the shade of the trees.\n\nUnsurprisingly, all of these buildings utilize the stone and marble from older buildings scattered around the island, some dating back centuries."
 rhodes.0051.a:0 "Spending time praying in this beautiful place is a good idea."
 rhodes.0051.b:0 "I’ll inspect the fort to see how its defenses are holding up."
 rhodes.0051.c:0 "It’s important I relax with others of good standing in those villas."
 rhodes.0052.t:0 "The Rocky Outcrop"
 rhodes.0052.desc:0 "[rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier] has always been famed for its defenses. It has recently come to my attention, however, that the island’s fortifications could use some improvement.\n\nThere is an area of the island with some rather rough terrain, and the old ruins of an abandoned fort lie there. If we had the right resources, perhaps we can (albeit with some difficulty) drag the stones and wood up these slopes onto this rocky outcrop and build a new small fort."
 rhodes.0052.a:0 "Yes, that sounds like a good idea."
 rhodes.0052.b:0 "On second thought, we don’t need to."
 rhodes.0053.t:0 "Kapamas"
 rhodes.0053.desc:0 "I visited a local aristocrat living in [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier], and was served a small feast consisting of different delicious dishes from the island. The highlight of the feast must have been the Rhodian #italic kapamas#!, which is the meat of a kid goat stuffed with rice, ground meat, onions, and other herbs and spices."
 rhodes.0053.a:0 "Tasty, tasty!"
 rhodes.0054.t:0 "Melekouni"
 rhodes.0054.desc:0 "While traveling to some villages in [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier] on official business, my guides offered me #italic melekouni#!, a traditional Rhodian snack made with sesame seeds and honey. It is simple but highly praised, and great for ensuring one has energy on a trip."
 rhodes.0054.a:0 "I am fine and don’t need it."
 rhodes.0054.b:0 "Sounds delicious #italic and#! healthy."
 rhodes.0055.t:0 "Inspecting Lindos"
 rhodes.0055.desc:0 "I am presently on a routine inspection of the fortifications of the acropolis of Lindos, in [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier]. One can easily see why people have fortified this place over the centuries given its excellent defensible location. Here, it is common to see both ancient and contemporary structures, architecture, artwork, and ruins mix together freely in this location.\n\nI am now just passing by the stone relief of an ancient Rhodian trieme, a somewhat famous landmark among the locals. At the foot of Lindos’ acropolis, this beautiful and majestic artwork was carved centuries ago, and still looks relatively intact."
 rhodes.0055.a:0 "I, too, hope to defend the island as well as the ancients did."
 rhodes.0056.t:0 "Aspri Petra"
 rhodes.0056.desc:0 "The island of Kos lies a little north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier]. I don’t always get to visit, but I do come every now and then on official business and to enjoy the sights. Today, I was a little adventurous and hiked out of town to see a stone cave and rock formation called Aspri Petra. Not too many go to this place, so it is a nice spot to relax."
 rhodes.0056.a:0 "To imagine it’s been here, all this time, for eons…."
 rhodes.0057.t:0 "Mount Attavyros"
 rhodes.0057.desc:0 "The highest point on the island of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier] is known as Mount Attavyros. It is considered a site of great spiritual importance by some locals, and a few brave the arduous trek every now and then up to the peak. According to those who have been there, one can see many other islands in the Dodecanese from the peak on a clear day, but I have heard some claim they can even see Crete."
 rhodes.0057.a:0 "I doubt that’s possible, but I’m sure it is a nice place."
 rhodes.0057.b:0 "If only I had the time to go there! It must be amazing."
 rhodes.0057.c:0 "Why not go on a little excursion there? I’ll do it soon!"
 rhodes.0058.t:0 "Kalymnian Sponge Economy"
 rhodes.0058.desc:0 "The sponges harvested by the sponge divers from Kalymnos, north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier], are famous around the world, and they are always bringing the island great profit. However, lately, the sponge industry has not been doing as well, as the island has been selling less than usual."
 rhodes.0058.a:0 "I hope things change for them soon."
 rhodes.0059.t:0 "Kalymnian Sponge Economy"
 rhodes.0059.desc:0 "The sponges harvested by the sponge divers from Kalymnos, north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier], are famous around the world, and they are always bringing the island great profit. However, lately, the sponge industry is doing even better and selling more than usual."
 rhodes.0059.a:0 "That’s good for the local economy!"

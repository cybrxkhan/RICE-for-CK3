 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_name: "Blood of Cleopatra the Scholar"
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_desc: "The Romans and their descendants slandered queen Cleopatra as a lustful tyrant, yet here in the Middle East, we tell other stories: stories of a woman who was not only a wise, just queen but also a brilliant scholar and philosopher."
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_chapter_opening_new_title: "The Nile River is eternal, its waters rising and falling with a rhythm that has gone uninterrupted for centuries. So too, do kingdoms and dynasties rise and fall with a similar rhythm along the lands of the Nile. It takes a hero of destiny, one born of a great lineage, to unite the lands of the Nile into one mighty, united empire, however. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] was one such hero, descended from the very Cleopatra whose wisdom and intellect made her the enemy of the fearsome Romans." 
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "Many kings and queens had tried to conquer the entire Nile River valley over the centuries, but most failed. Uniting people of different cultures, religions, and ways of life was no simple task. Where others failed, however, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] succeeded, for [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] was inspired by the glory of Cleopatra, whose blood rain in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] veins: the return of her dynasty meant a new day and age for the lands of the Nile, a new hope for a more prosperous and more just society."
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "The Romans denigrated the great queen Cleopatra as a harlot, but [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNicknamedNoTooltip] and the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] knew better. They knew that the true legacy of Cleopatra was in her patronage of the arts, her mastery of science and philosophy that made her the equal of the greatest scholars of her day, and her peerless wisdom and cleverness that made the Romans envy her: it was #italic these#! stories of Cleopatra, long lost in the Western lands but still remembered elsewhere, that [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNicknamedNoTooltip] emulated in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] rule."
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_chapter_extra_deed_new_title: "Through [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] efforts to first unify the followers of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.GetName] and the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetName] clans, and then to unify the rest of the Nile Valley, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] worked hard to emulate Cleopatra's ideals. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] patronized the greatest artisans and scholars of the land, bringing forth a new age of learning and sophistication not seen in ages; [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] reformed laws and ensured that all from the highest of the high to the lowest of the low were treated fairly; and [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] won the admiration of many for [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] prudent and intellectual way of life."
 RICE_nile_cleopatra_scholar_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "Perhaps one day, the empire that [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] founded will also fade into the dust of history; kingdoms and dynasties rise and fall just like how the waters of the Nile rise and fall without fail, of course. But if and when that happens, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will no doubt be remembered as one of the great leaders of the region, one who truly embodied the greatness of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] esteemed ancestor Cleopatra."

It is not only the oldest [christian.GetAdjective] monastery still in operation, but it is also home to many sacred landmarks and fascinating sights, from the Well of Moses and the Burning Bush to the relics of Saint Catherine.\n\nLittle wonder that it has remained a popular place of pilgrimage to this day.\n\nI, too, aim to be one of those pilgrims, who seek to be spiritually inspired by this spiritual glory. I will brave the harsh and rugged deserts of the Sinai, and reach this great monastery one way or another."

Still, I am happy to have arrived at the monastery at long last.\n\nJust thinking about it, I know while I am here, there will be much to do, much to see, and much time spent in prayer."

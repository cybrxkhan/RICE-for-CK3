The Abbasid Caliph, Al-Mu‘tamid, offered him various governorships in Iran out of fear of his growing power, but Ya‘qub refused them and marched on Baghdad, only to be defeated in 876. Though Ya‘qub‘s attack has traditionally been interpreted as a sign of his power-hungry, even irreligious nature, it is possible that he, as a holy warrior, may have seen Al-Mu‘tamid as unworthy and sought to replace him with a more deserving Abbasid.\n\nYa‘qub passed away in 879 and while his status as a proto-nationalist is perhaps a touch exaggerated, there is no doubt that his career marked the early stages of the disintegration of Abbasid authority in Iran, and the rise of various Iranian potentates."

Much of his early reign was focused on restoring order to various territories that had slipped from Ya‘qub‘s authority while the latter was distracted in the west. Eventually, Amr and the Caliph Al-Mu‘tamid even had to put aside their differences, given various Iranian warlords who threatened their mutual interests.\n\nThe Samanids were the ones to undo Amr, defeating him in 900 CE. Though Amr was technically the Caliph‘s representative, the Caliph must have found his erstwhile ally‘s defeat expedient; the Samanids sent Amr to the Caliph in chains, and he was later executed.\n\nThough Amr‘s descendants survived and ruled as petty lords for another century, they would never reach their apogee of power again."

Eventually, Tahir and his brother Ya‘qub got into conflict with Sebük-Eri, who allied himself with the Caliph.\n\nThough Tahir and Ya‘qub were defeated, Sebük-Eri‘s good fortunes did not last long; his ambitions were dashed when the Caliph sent a punitive expedition against him.

 yazd.0054.b:0 "Build a school there so younger generations can learn from the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText]."
 yazd.0054.c:0 "Build a mausoleum in memory of a popular [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to inspire locals."
 yazd.0054.d:0 "I am not interested in sponsoring construction projects right now."
 yazd.0055.t:0 "Yazdi Silk"
 yazd.0055.desc:0 "[yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] has, for a long time, been one of the regional centers of silk production in Iran. Though this silk, called #italic yazdi#!, cannot compete in quality with Chinese silk, it still fetches a decent price and is one of the city’s more popular exports.\n\nRecently, it has become even more popular, perhaps due to various changes in the economy or increased demand elsewhere. At any rate, it is bringing the city’s merchants even greater profits."
 yazd.0055.a:0 "Good! Good to hear!"
 yazd.0056.t:0 "Sarv-e Abarkuh"
 yazd.0056.desc:0 "Today I am paying a visit to [abarquh_barony.GetNameNoTier] which is not too far from [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier]. One landmark of note that I pass by is the #italic Sarv-e Abarkuh#!, or the Cypress of Abarkuh. The tree is very old and majestic, and local Zoroastrians claim the tree was planted by Zoroaster himself eons ago."
 yazd.0056.a:0 "I doubt Zoroaster planted it himself, but it is a nice tree."
 yazd.0056.b:0 "Though I am a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], I feel awe seeing the tree, too."
 yazd.0056.c:0 "It is a privilege to see such an ancient tree! I'll relax for a while."
 yazd.0056.d:0 "As a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], I don’t care too much about it."
 yazd.0056.e:0 "This is a sacred site. I should pray here for a bit while I’m here."
 yazd.0057.t:0 "Jewel of the Desert"
 yazd.0057.desc:0 "I am hosting an important dignitary in [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] and showing him the wonders of the city. One thing he seems most impressed by is the great number of qanat waterways and windcatchers in the city.\n\n“Verily, [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] is a jewel of the desert,” the man remarks, “as it has such wonderful amenities.”"
 yazd.0057.a:0 "I couldn’t agree more with you. It’s a truly lovely place!"
 yazd.0057.b:0 "It wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of the locals. "
 yazd.0058.t:0 "Baklava of Yazd"
 yazd.0058.desc:0 "For centuries, [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] has been known for making some of the best baklava in all of Iran. I just had the opportunity to get my hands on some, which was given to me as a gift by some locals under my rule. The baklava made in Iran is a little lighter than baklava from other lands, and a unique aspect of it is how its syrup is strongly flavored by rose water and cardamom."
 yazd.0058.a:0 "Delicious baklava… so, so delicious."
 yazd.0059.t:0 "Desert Trip"
 yazd.0059.desc:0 "Today I needed to make a quick trip to a village not too far from [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier]. The trek home, however, was a little rough - [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] lies in between two deserts, the #italic Dasht-e Kavir#! and the #italic Dasht-e Lut#!, so the wilderness surrounding the settlement is often a scorching, arid place. Sweating and tired, I am so relieved when I finally enter the city! The gardens, qanats, and windcatchers of [yazd_county.GetNameNoTier] make it feel like such a rejuvenating paradise after a long day of walking in the desert."
 yazd.0059.a:0 "I am glad I made it!"

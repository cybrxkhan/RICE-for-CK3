 upper_egypt.0063.desc:0 "I am hearing a sermon by a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] who hails from my territories along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName].\n\nIn the sermon, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] talks about how [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] favors us, and this explains why the Nile flood happens, and how it is thanks to the grace of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] that we can harness the bounty of Egypt. When we honor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and follow the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religion, the Nile inundation is excellent; when we disappoint [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and commit sin, we get a poor Nile inundation to remind us to be humble and avoid sin. And so, without [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], we would have no crops to harvest along the Nile."
 upper_egypt.0063.a:0 "Verily, it is so! The food we get from the Nile is thanks to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 upper_egypt.0063.b:0 "While true, a good harvest is also thanks to everyone’s hard work."
 upper_egypt.0064.t:0 "Praying By The Nile"
 upper_egypt.0064.desc:0 "I was traveling in in [county.GetNameNoTier], along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName], when I came across several [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] facing the Nile river and praying. When I asked them what they were doing, they explained they were praying to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to ensure we would have a good inundation the next time the Nile flooded. After all, though having the Nile flood is predictable, the results of its inundation are not."
 upper_egypt.0064.a:0 "I need to get going, but I wish you the best."
 upper_egypt.0064.b:0 "Perhaps I can join you in your prayers?"
 upper_egypt.0065.t:0 "Nilometer Records"
 upper_egypt.0065.desc:0 "It has come to my attention that a scholar I am acquainted with recently compiled some information regarding the Nile inundation recently. Thanks to the Nilometers found all over the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName], we have relatively accurate records of how good the Nile flood was, going back centuries.\n\nI have thought about taking a little time off from my daily duties to study these records, and discuss the information contained therein with other local scholars. Perhaps this knowledge can offer me some insights on how to better manage my territories along the Nile."
 upper_egypt.0065.a:0 "Yes, this is important knowledge for a leader like me to have."
 upper_egypt.0065.b:0 "I don’t have time. I already have people to advise me on the Nile."
 upper_egypt.0066.t:0 "Repurposing a Temple"
 upper_egypt.0066.desc:0 "Ancient monuments and grand structures built eons ago are a common sight along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName]. Some are large enough that they can be reused for various purposes even after they were long abandoned.\n\nAt any rate, according to a local official in [county.GetNameNoTier], villagers there have shown interest in using one such building, which appears to be some kind of old temple complex. These villagers intend to build houses, shops, and other necessary structures inside this temple to expand their village. The idea is that it would be efficient to make use of the temple walls, which are strong, sturdy, and have lasted for generations, instead of building randomly in some other place.\n\nHowever, although the village sits at a strategic location, it is not the wealthiest settlement out there, and it needs some assistance in order for this to happen."
 upper_egypt.0066.a:0 "By all means! I can financially support this endeavor."
 upper_egypt.0066.b:0 "I can’t aid them at this time, but I wish them good luck."

It is a hearty stew of fava beans mixed with olive oil and various spices and garnishes, popular among many in this region for generations."

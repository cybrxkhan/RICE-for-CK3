  bao.0001.desc:0 "My soldiers bring forth two young black-costumed men whom they arrested outside my residence.\n\n"This low-born rabble was found sleeping in a dried ditch, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," one of my soldiers says when asked who they are. "They say they are church musicians, but they were acting suspiciously, and it is clear they are highway robbers who are using your property without permission."\n\nAnother soldier interjects, "While I do agree they are acting suspiciously, we shouldn't be too hasty to make any judgment.\n\nThe first soldier ignores the other's comment, and says, "They are highwaymen, whether you like it or not, so I suggest we give them a swift exemplary punishment for trespassing.""
  bao.0001.a:0 "Do so! And seize their possessions!"
  bao.0001.b:0 "Send the two back to their home."
  bao.0001.c:0 "They seem like good lads. Let's recruit them!"
  bao.0001.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Up until the mid XXth century, costumes were the most reliable way to tell the social status of a stranger; in Brittany, black costumes were un-embroided costumes for the poorest of the poor. The "Sonerien Du" or "Black Musicians" were traveling singers and musicians paid mostly in food and drink, who went from church to church, mass to mass, and wedding to wedding to do their trade. They had the reputation of playing "hep diskrog" or "restlessly" and according to local superstition, a Breton wedding could only end when the musician was too drunk to play. They often were seen as troublemakers by the Gendarmes and the upper stratas of Breton society.\n The actual "Sonerien Du" legend which is the reference for the event is the legend of the Bro Vigouden (Barony of Kemper) where two black-coated musicians were injustly punished around 1790 in Pont-'n-Abad (Pont-l'-Abbé in French) and sentenced to death for sleeping dead drunk in the roadside, either because they were mistaken for highway robbers or as the result of the corruption of the local aristocracy. Their bodies were exposed on spikes for everyone to see. Because this event coincided with (unverified) plague outbreaks, people held them as martyrs, and would touch the bodies, believing it would grant plague immunity."

However, my presence was seen as a threat by the Muslim governors of Egypt, even though I and my warriors held off the infidels to the south.\n\nEventually, I involved myself in the petty squabbles of these Sudanese chieftains and ravaged their lands and raided their settlements for slaves, and at the same time also clashed many times with the governor of Egypt, [ibn_tulun.GetTitledFirstName]. Alas, I bit more than I could chew, and was driven back to my base in the mountains of [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier], which are host to many lucrative mines.\n\nNow, after licking my wounds, I will prepare to reassert myself as a local power.

 red_sea.0023.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! When al-Umari arrived in Egypt sometime in the 850s CE, he already had with him quite some wealth which he accumulated during his years as a scholar, adventurer, and merchant.\n\nal-Umari invested in the slave trade as well as the mines around the area of Wadi Allaqi, and, after establishing a base in Aswan, got involved in local political conflicts. His mining business was kept afloat by his notorious slave raids into Nubia; slaves were captured in such large amounts that a later historian from the Mamluk era, Al-Maqrizi, claims that most of the consorts of the men in Aswan were Nubian slaves. Over time, and not undeservedly, he developed a reputation for ruthlessness.\n\nal-Umari's presence in Egypt was of great concern to the new Abbasid governor Ibn Tulun, who sought to centralize the authority of the Egyptian state. A Tulunid force was dispatched in 868 CE to bring al-Umari to heel but was soundly defeated. Eventually, al-Umari's brutality was his undoing; his own men assassinated him and sent his head to Ibn Tulun. Though Ibn Tulun was probably pleased at his rival's demise in private, he publically embalmed and buried al-Umari's head with great respect, and repaid the treachery of those who had delivered it with a summary execution.\n\nAll in all, al-Umari's life reflects the growing power of warlords in this era who sought to build their own private wealth and power at the expense of the Abbasid state."

 red_sea.0021.desc:0 "I was born in Medina many years ago, and started off not as a man of the sword, or a man of the coin, but as a man of letters and learning. For all the ruthlessness my enemies ascribe to me, I am still a scholar at heart, one who has studied deeply the #italic Hadith#! and who can recite poetry without pause. My travels took me all over the lands nominally ruled by the Abbasids, from Fustat where I studied for many years to the spiritual center in Kairouan. These experiences shaped me and made me who I am, particularly..."
 red_sea.0021.a:0 "My childhood in Medina, which I remember fondly, even if it was long ago."

 red_sea.0022.t:0 "al-'Umari's Plan"
 red_sea.0022.desc:0 "Through a series of events, I stumbled into the Eastern Desert, that patch of arid land between the Nile and the Red Sea. With my reputation as an erudite and pious scholar, I attracted a large following who helped me establish a base in [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier], where we began large scale mining operations, most prominently of gold; the profits were immense. However, my presence was seen as a threat by the Muslim governors of Egypt, even though I and my warriors held off the infidels to the south.\n\nEventually, I involved myself in the petty squabbles of these Sudanese chieftains and ravaged their lands and raided their settlements for slaves, and at the same time also clashed many times with the governor of Egypt, [ibn_tulun.GetTitledFirstName]. Alas, I bit more than I could chew, and was driven back to my base in the mountains of [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier], which are host to many lucrative mines.\n\nNow, after licking my wounds, I will prepare to reassert myself as a local power. Some warn me to not be too foolhardy, too greedy, or too bloodthirsty, but I am older and wiser now. I have thought carefully about my next steps."
 red_sea.0022.a:0 "[ibn_tulun.GetTitledFirstName] will accept me as [ibn_tulun.GetHerHis] equal, if not [ibn_tulun.GetHerHis] superior!"
 red_sea.0022.b:0 "I will continue to profit off my attacks on the infidels of the Sudan."
 red_sea.0022.c:0 "Maybe [ibn_tulun.GetTitledFirstName] and I can come to an agreement and work together."

 red_sea.0023.desc:0 "I will not repeat my mistakes this time, and will become even greater than I was before! I am a descendant of the Caliphs! I am the scholar who has mastered the #italic Hadith#! and poetry! I am the warlord whose soldiers strike fear into the hearts of the Tulunids to the north and the heathens of Sudan to the south! I am the adventurer whose acumen has turned the Eastern Desert from barren voids of sand and rock, to the land of thriving mines, full of caravans carting gold and emeralds daily to the cities of the Nile and the ports of the Red Sea!"
 red_sea.0023.desc.focus_tulun:0 "\n\nI will focus my efforts on neutralizing the threat that [ibn_tulun.GetTitledFirstName] poses. As ruler of Egypt, [ibn_tulun.GetSheHe] is irate at the fact that I control these lands along the Red Sea and the Eastern Desert, and will scheme against me at every step I take. Though I have defeated [ibn_tulun.GetHerHim] twice already, I must be wary and vigilant, for just as much as I am a thorn on [ibn_tulun.GetHerHis] side, so is [ibn_tulun.GetSheHe] a thorn on my side."

For years, I raided them for slaves, earning myself as much profit as my precious metal mines did. I did make the mistake of underestimating how powerful these chieftains could be.

I must concede that some of my men were right when they previously told me I was too reckless in my actions. I learned my lesson.

 red_sea.0023.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! When al-Umari arrived in Egypt sometime in the 850s CE, he already had with him quite some wealth which he accumulated during his years as a scholar, adventurer, and merchant.\n\nal-Umari invested in the slave trade as well as the mines around the area of Wadi Allaqi, and, after establishing a base in Aswan, got involved in local political conflicts. His mining business was kept afloat by his notorious slave raids into Nubia; slaves were captured in such large amounts that a later historian from the Mamluk era, Al-Maqrizi, claims that most of the consorts of the men in Aswan were Nubian slaves. Over time, and not undeservedly, he developed a reputation for ruthlessness.\n\nal-Umari's presence in Egypt was of great concern to the new Abbasid governor Ibn Tulun, who sought to centralize the authority of the Egyptian state. A Tulunid force was dispatched in 868 CE to bring al-Umari to heel but was soundly defeated. Eventually, al-Umari's brutality was his undoing; his own men assassinated him and sent his head to Ibn Tulun. Though Ibn Tulun was probably pleased at his rival's demise in private, he publically embalmed and buried al-Umari's head with great respect, and repaid the treachery of those who had delivered it with a summary execution.\n\nAll in all, al-Umari's life reflects the growing power of warlords in this era who sought to build their own private wealth and power at the expense of the Abbasid state."

 red_sea.0030.desc:0 "A couple explorers, well-known in the Red Sea region, are visiting my court. They are skilled navigators in the deep sea, known as #italic mu’allim#!, and are explaining to me some of the basics of their art. These men have dedicated their entire lives to mastering astronomical knowledge and applying it to travel between the Indian Ocean ports.\n\nI notice these #italic mu’allim#! have a dismissive attitude towards the #italic rubban#! - local ship captains who have experience mainly sailing in only the Red Sea. However, many here know that the #italic rubban#! are full of lore about local geography, such as various reefs and islands in the Red Sea and how to traverse them. Ultimately, it seems these #italic mu’allim#! see the knowledge of the #italic rubban#! as inferior to theirs."

One such vessel has just washed up on shore in my territory; it has a large haul of loot, and the ship's owners and crew are all foreign heathens. My soldiers have detained them - their captain is suspicious of these traders' motivations, as they could be spies or degenerates from other realms! He suggests I enslave these barbarians and take their goods. After all, it's common practice in this region, so I consider his advice carefully."
 red_sea.0031.a:0 "Yes, enslave the survivors and take their goods."
 red_sea.0031.b:0 "Enslavement is too much. Let's just take their goods."

Perhaps I can show my generous and thoughtful side?"

 red_sea.0033.desc:0 "A prominent Muslim nobleman from afar is partaking in the Hajj pilgrimage, traveling through the Red Sea route, and is stopping through my lands. Some in my court suggest that I should host this man while he is here - once he returns from his pilgrimage and travels back across the Red Sea, who knows what good things he might say about me? However, it is known that this man is something of a snob with pretentious tastes. Ironic, isn’t it, that he is on a pilgrimage and does not appear to show any humility?"

 red_sea.0034.a:0 "A sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]! Let them graze here as long as they wish."

Recently, one such caravan, owned by a prominent local merchant, was attacked by a band of hyenas while they were camping at night, as often happens in this region. Such hyena attacks generally don’t cause much harm to people, but can be disruptive to business. The merchant was trading in foodstuff, in fact, and the hyenas ate quite a number of his products! Anyways, since this man is relatively well-known, perhaps it may do to show some generosity and assist him after this personal setback."

 red_sea.0037.desc:0 "I am hosting a prominent Muslim aristocrat who just finished his pilgrimage to Mecca, and is now journeying home. As I ask him to tell me stories of how his adventure went, he tells me the most frightening part of the journey was crossing the Red Sea by ferry boat.\n\n“I had never been out at sea before!” he explains. “I had to cling onto my slave to prevent myself from vomiting the whole time. She was born in a coastal land, you see, and used to being on a boat, and she laughed at me for my weakness - I might have whipped the feisty girl then and there had it not been for my fondness for her… or maybe I was just too queasy to respond....”"

 red_sea.0039.t:0 "Encounter Along the Red Sea"
 red_sea.0039.desc:0 "The Red Sea has been inhabited for centuries, both by roving bands of nomads as well as colonies from larger kingdoms. Earlier today, when traveling through a part of my realm along the Red Sea coast, we came across what appeared to be an old structure of some kind along the shore, which was a small, abandoned hut or mud and reeds. Who knows whether it was built a decade ago, or centuries ago?\n\nWhile resting there, a large party of herdsmen passed through. They were traveling to a nearby town to trade with the local merchants, and offered to exchange some of their goods with us."

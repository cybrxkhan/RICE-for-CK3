Even after Afghanistan was Islamicized, Muslim attitudes towards the Bamiyan Buddha Statues have varied over time and place, in contrast to the Taliban government's destruction of the statues in 2001. For instance, local folklore believed the two statues to be star-crossed lovers who were turned into stone; these stories were influential among the Hazara people who lived in Bamiyan for centuries, to the point some scholars theorized the Taliban destroyed the statues as part of their ongoing oppression of the Hazaras. Medieval Islamic scholars and poets categorized and even praised the statues and their beauty as #italic 'aja'ib#!, or wonders to be marveled. For instance, Jahangir Mirza, the brother of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, took a detour while on a military expedition to sightsee in Bamian in 1506 CE."

The rituals must then be continuously performed until one reaches the statues. I can only hope that the Buddhas will assist me in staying focused, so I don’t botch these rituals, because if I do, then I am supposed to go back to the location where I first saw the idols, and do this all over again."

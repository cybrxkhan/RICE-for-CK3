 SHEN_GARDEN_GLOSS: "#bold Shěn Garden#! is one of the most famous landmarks in the city of Shàoxīng (historically called Kuàijī) in northeastern Zhèjiāng. The garden existed since at least the Sòng Dynasty, and is famously associated with the famously tragic love story between the poet Lù Yóu and his first wife, Táng Wǎn, who was forced to divorce. Eight years after the divorce, the two encountered each other by the garden, and exchanged poetry, before she passed away within a year. In old age, more than five decades later, in the last year of his life, Lù Yóu revisited the garden to write another set of famous poems, mournfully reflecting on love and the passage of time."

 YOU_SHOU_GLOSS: "The term #bold yóushǒu#! has been used throughout Chinese history to refer to a certain type of urban idlers. During the Song era, for instance, increased urbanization led to a growing number of unemployed idlers and flaneurs in cities. For instance, Zhōu Mì, a 13th century writer, notes in his Wǔlín Jiùshì, a record of his memories of Hangzhou, that “In the bustling and crowded districts, people gathered in groups; the flaneur were clever and treacherous, and there were a lot of this type.” Chinese records note different ways officials attempted to deal with the yóushǒu across various dynasties." # 游手
 WO_YOU_GLOSS: "#bold Wòyóu#!, which translates to traveling while lying at ease, was a leisurely activity enjoyed historically in China, for those who could not visit a famous landmark or tourist sight, especially if they were physically unable to, such as due to illness or old age. For instance, paintings of the [RICE_ten_scenes_of_west_lake|E] were popular starting in the Sòng Dynasty as a way to show people who couldn’t or hadn’t visited it what it could offer." # 臥游

(Victory Cake) is a dessert made from glutinous rice, white sugar, and sweet red bean paste that is pinkish in flavor and native to the area around Hángzhōu. Legend has it that during the Sòng Dynasty, these cakes would be emblazoned with the words Dìngshèng, meaning Victory, and given to soldiers before battle to wish them luck." # 定胜糕
 WINDING_STREAM_PARTY_GLOSS: "#bold Winding stream parties#! was a traditional kind of gathering dating back to ancient China. Participants would wait by a winding stream; someone else would let a cup of rice wine float down the stream, and the poets had to compose poems before the cup reached them. Later on, the custom spread to other parts of Asia influenced by China, such as Korea and Japan." # 流觞曲水

 FOUR_BEAUTIES_GLOSS: "The #bold Four Great Beauties#! were four women renowned for not only their beauty, but their impact and influence in Chinese history. Traditionally, the canonical four beauties are identified as Xī Shī, Wáng Zhāojūn, Diāo Chán, and Yáng Guìfēi, though in the past there were other variations of this list. There are four idioms traditionally associated with each:\n\nXī Shī sinks fish\nDiāo Chán eclipses the moon\nWáng Zhāojūn entices birds into falling\nYáng Guìfēi shames flowers\n\nA merged idiom of these is #italic sinks fish and entices birds to fall, eclipses the moon and shames flowers#!."

 DEATH_POEM_GLOSS: "The #bold Death Poem#! is a genre of poetry from the Sinosphere (i.e. China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam), typically written before the author's death, whether from natural causes or not (such as before an execution), as they reflect on their life and impending demise. A famous example is the last poem written by the Japanese monk Bashō, generally considered a poem of farewell:\n#italic Falling ill on a journey\nmy dreams go wandering\nover withered fields#!\n\nThough most death poems were serious, occasionally, some would contain sarcastic or comedic elements, such as this death poem by the Japanese monk Tokō (1710-1795), reflecting on the pretentiousness of some death poems:\n\n#italic Death poems\nare mere delusion –\ndeath is death.#!"

  # I used one of the shorter translations to ensure the text could fit comfortably on a gloss tooltip.
  # Sadly, as we all know, translations can lose some of the nuances of the original (as the Italians say, "traduttore, traditore," i.e., "translator, traitor")

 LU_YOU_PHOENIX_HAIRPIN_GLOSS: "#bold Phoenix Hairpin#! (Lù Yóu)\n\n#italic Fine, pink hands; yellow sealed wine –\nThe town is filled with Spring’s colours but\nThe willows remain trapped within the palace.\nFine east winds, short happiness –\nGloomy spirits, separated for years.\nWrong! Wrong! Wrong!\n\nSame old Spring, haggard looks,\nSilk handkerchief stained pink with tears.\nPeach blossoms fall, ponds and pavilions empty.\nOaths and promises remain but brocade undelivered.\nNo! No! No!#!"
 TANG_WAN_PHOENIX_HAIRPIN_GLOSS: "#bold Phoenix Hairpin#! (Táng Wǎn)\n\n#italic Sympathy is lacking, people are unkind,\nRain at dusk cause flowers to tumble.\nDry whipping winds, drying sad tears.\nWishing to unfold matters of the heart,\nMurmuring alone by the banister.\nHard! Hard! Hard!\n\nOn our separate ways, we’re now different from before,\nThe ailing spirit often drifts and sways like the swing.\nCold horn signals, night will soon end.\nFear of being questioned,\nTears are awallowed to feign contentment.\nPretend! Pretend! Pretend!#!"

 LU_YOU_SHEN_GARDEN_TWO_POEMS_GLOSS: "#bold Two Poems on Shěn Garden#!\n\n#italic The setting sun on the city wall, the painted horn's mournful sound.\nShěn Garden is no longer the same ponds and terraces of old.\nBeneath the heartbroken bridge, spring waves gleam green,\nOnce reflected the fleeting grace of her who came.\n\nDreams shattered, fragrance faded—forty years have passed.\nShěn Garden's willows are old, no longer shedding down.\nThis body will soon become earth of Mount Jī,\nYet I linger by these traces, tears welling up.#!"

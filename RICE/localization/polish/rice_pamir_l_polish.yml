 # Legends
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_new_title_name: "Return of the Hephthalites"
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_new_title_desc: "Generations ago, the [original_culture.GetCollectiveNoun] struck fear into the Iranian and Indian worlds as the White Huns. Under [founder.GetTitledFirstName], they returned, even stronger, wealthier, and more intimidating than before."
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_chapter_opening_new_title: "From the Pamir Mountains, the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] swept into the fertile farmlands and opulent cities of the Iranian and Indian worlds. Known by many names, such as the White Huns, they were feared by all peoples – even other nomad tribes along the Silk Road. But all things had to come to an end, and the old [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] suffered defeat and was torn apart by its enemies." 
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "Scattered descendants of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] survived as petty rump states along the farmlands and cities and mountains of the Silk Road. Among them were a tirbe of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip], led by the visionary [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] sought to restore [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] people to their former glory, and estabish a new Empire of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip]."
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "Though the ancient [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] were warriors, they were also traders, city-builders, and artisans. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] thus had to emulate [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] illustrious forebears as a ruler of many skills. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] encouraged trade, founded new settlements, patronized the arts, and built many [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFaith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFaith.HouseOfWorshipPlural] and great monuments to [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_chapter_extra_deed_new_title: "However, of course, as a true child of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip], [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] greatest achievements were military in nature. Countless tribes, countless cities, and countless so-called kings kneeled before [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]: some from surrendering wisely, knowing it was foolish to resist; and others after suffering defeat at the hands of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] fearsome warriors."
 RICE_hephthalite_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "As they say, winter doesn't last forever, for spring comes, and snows melt. Snows #italic always#! melt. Like the peaks of the Pamir mountains from where the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'original_culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] originally established their homeland, their descendants, the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip], under [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], spread forth like an avalanche from the Pamirs. Yet like melted snow which turns into life-giving water, the newly formed [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] was not merely a destructive force. By reviving the old [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] and its legacy and traditions, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] initiated a new, more prosperous era along the Silk Road."

A couple years later, in 869, the last Zunbil, named Firuz ibn Kabk in Arab sources, escaped Saffarid captivity and rallied followers to fight the Muslims.\n\nThe Zunbil Dynasty came to an end in 870 CE when Firuz was defeated by a Saffarid force."

 pamir.0067.desc:0 "Though I am enjoying the Chinir Feast, not everyone can come. Those who are too old and feeble, or are ill, often cannot be present for obvious reasons. Therefore, it is customary for some people to volunteer to bring food to the elderly and those who are sick during the feast. It can be an arduous thing, though, and I fear if I help, I might catch someone’s illness."

 pamir.0070.t:0 "Khundah"
 pamir.0070.desc:0 "During the harvesting season of the Chinir Festival, women and children are gathering fruits into baskets, and these will be used for many things. Some of the fruit, for example, is turned into #italic khundah#!, a sticky fruit sauce used in a variety of foods. One of the village women gives me some khundah to sample, and it is delicious."
 pamir.0070.a:0 "It tastes so sweet."
 pamir.0071.t:0 "Goat Meat"
 pamir.0071.desc:0 "It is common tradition that during the Chinir Festival, whenever a person helps someone outside their household with the harvest, that the one being helped offers some sheep or goat meat. The farmer whom I am helping harvest the crops for is offering me some said meat."
 pamir.0071.a:0 "Thank you!"
 pamir.0072.t:0 "Agriculture Lessons"
 pamir.0072.desc:0 "By assisting the farmers with the harvesting of grains during the Chinir Festival, I have learned quite a bit about agricultural work and various aspects of village life."
 pamir.0072.a:0 "It’s most enlightening."
 pamir.0073.t:0 "Gathering Leaves"
 pamir.0073.desc:0 "During the harvesting season, it is custom for people to start gathering leaves and putting them in sacks. Later, during the winter, these will be used as fodder for animals. This can start as early as the Chinir Festival, and I wonder if I should help those who have been assigned to this task in the village. It is an important thing, after all, so maybe I should contribute."
 pamir.0073.a:0 "Sure, why not? It sounds fun."
 pamir.0073.b:0 "I am not doing peasants’ work."
 pamir.0074.t:0 "Fruit Orchards"
 pamir.0074.desc:0 "As part of the harvest, women and children go to the orchards and gather baskets full of fruits. I observe some as they do this. Plump apricots and mulberries seem especially popular, and this is a more relaxed part of the harvest, where women and children take their time to socialize."
 pamir.0074.a:0 "I’ll observe and enjoy the scenery."
 pamir.0074.b:0 "It’s time to help them out!"
 pamir.0074.c:0 "Help them out, even if I’m a man."
 pamir.0075.t:0 "Apricots"
 pamir.0075.desc:0 "During the harvest, after the women and children start harvesting fruits from the orchards and groves, it is acceptable for people to start snacking on the fruits that are being picked within reason. I see a basket full of apricots and am tempted to eat some."
 pamir.0075.a:0 "I am hungry - it’s time to feast!"

Because of this, he was revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims alike.\n\nAs [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName] lived as a hermit not too far from the hamlet of Yamgan in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier] for much of his later life, his followers have brought his body there to be buried.

 pamir.0130.t:0 "Preparations"
 pamir.0130.desc:0 "I have started making plans to take a short, more modest local pilgrimage to the hamlet of Yamgan in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier]. In truth, I am not headed to Yamgan itself, but rather to a shrine near it - the shrine that houses the tomb of the famed [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName], the great poet, scholar, and holy man. In Badakhshan and many parts of around the Pamirs, though he was a proselytizer of the Ismaili sect in his lifetime, he is still revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the region. Many here take the opportunity to visit his shrine, and I aim to do likewise.\n\nI hope that by visiting this great man’s shrine, and emulating his example, I can strengthen my faith and become closer to Allah."
 pamir.0130.a:0 "It will be a good spiritual opportunity for me."
 pamir.0131.t:0 "To Yamgan"
 #pamir.0131.desc:0 "I have finished preparing for my trip to the shrine of [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName]. I bid my household farewell, and begin the journey through the Pamir mountains.\n\nMy destination? Yamgan, in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier].\n\nI hope that by visiting this great man’s shrine, and emulating his example, I can strengthen my faith and become closer to Allah."
 pamir.0131.a:0 "Onwards!"
 pamir.0132.t:0 "Arrival"
 pamir.0132.desc:0 "After a long and somewhat arduous trek, and after passing through the village of Yamgan, I have finally arrived at the site of the shrine. It is a small shrine, to say the least, the size of a modest house at best, yet I feel this somehow fits Nasir Khusraw perfectly - here rests no wealthy and decadent debauchee, but a humble, benevolent servant of Allah.\n\nIt is getting late, however, so I need to rest first; I’ll enter the shrine tomorrow. With that in mind, I make my way up the dirt path to another building, a pilgrim’s lodge which is next to a soup kitchen. There, I shall be no different than any of the other visitors, and my rank, status, wealth, and even the sect of Islam I follow means nothing, for Muslims of all sects have long paid their respects to Nasir Khusraw."
 pamir.0132.a:0 "We are all equal in the eyes of Allah."
 pamir.0133.t:0 "Entering the Shrine"
 pamir.0133.desc:0 "Morning is upon us. Today, I enter Nasir Khusraw’s shrine. First, though, I circumambulate around the shrine many times, saying various prayers.\n\nOnce done, I come inside, and see that there are several rooms, all just as humble-looking as the outside walls. I have heard from some that this building was, supposedly, where Nasir Khusraw lived for many years, writing poetry and such. I also notice there are many cuts and smudges on the wall, evidence of writings that devout pilgrims have scrawled on here over the years.\n\nI finally enter the room which has Nasir Khusraw’s tomb. Once again, it is relatively humble in appearance, yet this strangely fills me with more inspiration and joy. There are only a few other pilgrims here inside, and they mostly ignore me as they pray."
 pamir.0133.a:0 "I find an empty spot in the room."
 pamir.0134.t:0 "Prayer"
 pamir.0134.desc:0 "Before I begin praying, I look around the room again, taking in the experience. Though its appearance is humble, that does not mean it is unpleasant or bland; it is still nicely decorated, and I spot several holy objects. There is an incense burner and lamp on the shrine, for example, and more prominently, a copy of the Quran said to have been written by Nasir Khusraw himself.\n\nI refocus and remind myself I have not come here to admire the architecture, but to worship Allah and reflect on the holy life and deeds of Nasir Khusraw. I close my eyes for a moment, before I begin saying prayers."
 pamir.0134.a:0 "Praise be to Allah, the most merciful, the most benevolent…."
 pamir.0135.t:0 "Leaving a Mark"
 pamir.0135.desc:0 "Before I leave the shrine, there is one last thing I can do. It is custom here for pilgrims like me to leave behind some writing on the walls. Some deride this as graffiti of a sacred place, but many see it as a way to commemorate their visit, honor Allah and Nasir Khusraw, and, in a way, seek out one last blessing. Over the years, there have been several typical kinds of writings scrawled on the wall. If I wish to write anything on these walls, now would be the time, so I quietly make my way over to a corner of the building I find appealing, and prepare to write…."
 pamir.0135.a:0 "A copy of one of the beautiful poems Nasir Khusraw wrote."
 pamir.0135.b:0 "My own poem praising Allah, and hoping for the triumph of good."
 pamir.0135.c:0 "Prayers and guidance about worldly matters that worry me."
 pamir.0135.d:0 "Prayers for my relatives and friends, especially the deceased."
 pamir.0135.e:0 "Nothing. This is pointless. I should pray more instead of this."
 pamir.0135.message:0 "Nasir Khusraw has inspired you spiritually!"
 pamir.0136.t:0 "Charity?"
 pamir.0136.desc:0 "I emerge from the shrine, with my body invigorated and my mind buzzing with inspiration and joy. Now, I start preparing to go home.\n\nHowever, I remember how it is customary that when wealthy or powerful patrons visit the shrine of Nasir Khusraw, they give alms and share food with other pilgrims (especially those less fortunate than them) in honor of their visit before they leave. As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], perhaps I should take this opportunity to provide charity before I depart from here."
 pamir.0136.a:0 "I will do the obligatory amount of alms and sharing."
 pamir.0136.b:0 "Yes! I will donate as much as I can to everyone here."
 pamir.0136.c:0 "Why should I? I’ve already done enough charity."
 pamir.0137.t:0 "Returning Home"
 pamir.0137.desc:0 "After some more time trekking through the rugged wilderness of the Pamirs, it is time to return from my pilgrimage to the shrine and tomb of [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName]. I learned and experienced so much, and will certainly not forget this experience anytime soon."
 pamir.0137.a:0 "Such is the will of Allah! It was well worth it."

 pamir.0150.desc:0 "The winter solstice is nearly upon us, which means it is almost time to celebrate the Chawmos Festival. As a devotee of the gods, in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, it is important for me to participate in this event, for it is a sacred time of year, when we perform the necessary rituals to guide this year into the next, and to proper delineate that which is pure and that which is impure.\n\nI and other community leaders will gather the people of the nearby towns, and together, we will work hard to prepare a grand Chawmos for this year. Ultimately, despite the fun that we may and will have, we must take all of this seriously, and do our best to ensure the event is a spiritual success."
 pamir.0150.a:0 "Let’s get to work."
 pamir.0151.t:0 "Bandek"
 pamir.0151.desc:0 "Preparations for this year’s Chawmos are underway, but as is custom, I and several other prominent locals need to partake in the #italic Bandek#! ritual. Inevitably, people pass away during the course of the year, and the #italic Bandek#! is the opportunity for us to ritually invite relatives of the deceased to end their period of mourning, and rejoin the community. I will need to spend some time going door to door to some of these locals’ houses, and formally requesting them to join Chawmos."
 pamir.0151.a:0 "Let’s go without delay! Doing this is integral to the Chawmos’ success."
 pamir.0151.b:0 "I don’t need to greet peasants - other local leaders can go in my stead."
 pamir.0152.t:0 "Sarazari"
 pamir.0152.desc:0 "Chawmos officially begins with the #italic Sarazari#! ritual, which revolves around juniper, the sacred plant used in many of our purification rituals. I, as well as other nobles, villagers, travelers, and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], and others have gathered at a designated location to witness the #italic Sarazari#!. During this ritual, young boys and girls separate into two groups based on gender, and light the juniper branches in a competition to see who can create the most amount of smoke, all of which is dedicated to the god Balumain."
 pamir.0152.desc.boy:0 "\n\nThis year, it seems the boys have won, as the smoke they made is clearly more so than the girls’! After #italic Sarazari#! Is done, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] hold juniper branches and offer prayers.

 pamir.0153.desc:0 "Today is #italic Kuta’mru#!, an important day when the realms of the wilderness and civilization are most spiritually connected.\n\nIn the morning, children gather around the local temple for the #italic Chutayak#! ritual, where they paint the temple’s walls, doors, and columns with images of mountains, stars, various animals, and more. This is all done in complete silence.\n\nIn the afternoon, everyone focuses on making sculptures out of flour. These will be baked and displayed out in the pastures early next morning to symbolize their migration to the fields to graze, before they are sold to non-believers as we are not allowed to eat them. Typically, the sculptures depict shepherds or various animals; what shall I focus on sculpting this year?"
 pamir.0153.a:0 "Noble sheepdogs who guard our livestock."
 pamir.0153.b:0 "Wild stags who dwell in the rugged terrain."
 pamir.0153.c:0 "Cows who provide us with food, milk, and hide."
 pamir.0153.d:0 "Our humble and hard-working shepherds."
 pamir.0153.e:0 "Goats, for they are our most sacred animal."
 pamir.0154.t:0 "Madahik"
 pamir.0154.desc:0 "The next ritual in the Chawmos cycle is #italic Madahik#!, the day when we commemorate our dead ancestors. Outside the temple, we prepare a miniature wooden fortress called the #italic Chilikotik#!, where we place many items of food. After this tower of food is lit, we all hurry into the temple, to allow the ancestors time and space to visit. Inside the temple, an elder calls out, “Oh elders, come eat and drink, then leave.”\n\nOnce enough time has passed, we emerge from the temple. Outside, the #italic Chilikotik#! and all the food is completely burnt into ashes."
 pamir.0154.a:0 "Surely, the ancestors were satisfied this year."

 pamir.0155.desc:0 "It is time for the ritual of #italic Sawelik Hari#!, where we are expected to be rid of useless old possessions, and replace them with new ones. More entertainingly, it is time for a theatrical performance that satirizes the recent events of the previous year. Everyone roars with laughter as various community members are made fun of (all in good humor, of course). Earlier, when we were organizing the Chawmos festival, what did we agree on would be the theme of this year’s performance?"
 pamir.0155.a:0 "Various deeds (or misdeeds) I have accomplished"
 pamir.0155.b:0 "The trivial things that happen in the local villagers’ lives"
 pamir.0155.c:0 "News of grand events that occurred far away"
 pamir.0156.t:0 "Goshnik"
 pamir.0156.desc:0 "Today is #italic Goshnik#!, a crucial part of the Chawmos cycle, for today is the day we formally welcome children into our community, as practicing members of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith.\n\nBoys and girls around seven or eight years of age go through the #italic Chailaksambaik#!, where they put on traditional tunics and animals are sacrificed to them; the blood of these animals are sprinkled on the boys. Older boys, instead, go through a similar ritual called the the #italic Butsambaik#!."
 pamir.0156.desc.child:0 "\n\nAmong the children this year is my own progeny! Now, along with the other children, they all have been truly welcomed into our religion!"

 pamir.0157.desc:0 "Tonight is the night of #italic Ghona Chanja#!, where the god Balumain comes from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] on his heavenly steed to bless us. Though he is not the chief god, he is our divine protector who taught us the proper rituals aeons ago.\n\nAt midnight, we go to a high point near the village where stands a special altar, the #italic indraine#!. There, we offer Balumain food and animal sacrifices, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] leads us in prayers. What shall I ask Balumain to help me with?"
 pamir.0157.a:0 "I hope Balumain blesses me too."
 pamir.0158.t:0 "Lawak Bii'rik"
 pamir.0158.desc:0 "Following #italic Ghona Chanja#!, the next ceremony is the #italic Lawak Bii’rik#!, the day of the fox. Foxes are cunning animals, who are responsible for a year’s fortunes and misfortunes. As part of this ritual, young men begin to scour the nearby hills and forests in the early morning for foxes, playing loud drums and music near the caves the foxes live in to entice them to come out. If the first fox they see runs uphill, to the pure abode of the mountains, then good fortune shall befall on all the following year; if it runs downhill, then there shall be misfortune. If no fox is found… then perhaps they were too clever for us this year."
 pamir.0158.a:0 "What does the fox say?"
 pamir.0158.toast.good:0 "The fox went uphill!"
 pamir.0158.toast.neutral:0 "No foxes were found."
 pamir.0158.toast.bad:0 "The fox went downhill!"
 pamir.0159.t:0 "The Final Dance"
 pamir.0159.desc:0 "After the search for the fox is complete, at midday, everyone returns to the village, where the final and largest celebration takes place. While there is food and dance, there is one performance that takes center stage.\n\nIn the middle of the village square, many individuals have covered their faces. Not only that, many of them, masked or not, are dressed as the opposite gender: some men are dressed as women, and some women are dressed as men. Meanwhile, the men have been divided into two groups; the “pure” men sing solemn and honored songs of the past, while the “impure” men sing obscene melodies with wild rhythms. This, truly, is the culmination of the Chawmos: when the boundaries of the realms are broken down before they are rebuilt."
 pamir.0159.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 pamir.0160.t:0 "Chawmos Ends"
 pamir.0160.desc:0 "At long last, all of the rituals of Chawmos have been properly performed, and the weeks-long celebrations come to a close. What memories we’ve all made! The new year is upon us, and let us hope it proves to be a decent one."

Some say this killed the tyrant, but many others say this merely weakened him, and he hides in one of these valleys, using foul magic to curse the population every now and then, which is why re-enacting this event is necessary."

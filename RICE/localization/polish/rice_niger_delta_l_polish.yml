 game_concept_beaded_crown_desc:0 "The ruler of $c_ife$, called the Ooni, had and has great religious and secular authority among the Yoruba peoples. Historically, monarchs in the region would travel to $c_ife$ to be crowned by the Ooni with the special beaded crown of Oduduwa, a deity and progenitor of various Yoruba and Edo kings, to legitimize their rule.\n\nIn-game, the Ooni serves as the [head_of_faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_pagan$ [faith|E]. [rulers|E] who follow a [faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_religion$ [religion|E], or those in the region who meet other requirements, can take the [decision|E] travel to $c_ife$ to $RICE_niger_delta_request_beaded_crown$. After you select a gift to offer the Ooni, they will decide whether to accept it or reject the gift. If you are the Ooni yourself, you can receive gifts and crown [rulers|E] conversely.\n\nIf you follow a [faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_religion$ [religion|E], you will be stuck with the [GetModifier('RICE_niger_delta_uncrowned').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E] until you get the Ooni to agree to crown you."

 niger_delta.0112.desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] believe that the kola nut has great sacred and symbolic power. Thus, many people will swear oaths on them.\n\nIn a local village, a man was recently accused of a heinous crime. None of my officials or the community leaders could determine if he was guilty. To clear him of the allegations, he agreed to swear an oath in public before a kola nut.\n\nIn this ritual, a lobe of the kola nut was dropped to the ground, and the accused had to bend over to pick it up with his mouth, and if he was guilty, he would be struck down by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]. Anyways, nothing happened, and, thusly, if [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] find the accused to be innocent, then he #italic is#! innocent of any wrongdoing."
 niger_delta.0112.a:0 "Truly, the results of this ritual are clear."
 niger_delta.0112.b:0 "I’m not sure if he’s innocent, but that is our tradition."

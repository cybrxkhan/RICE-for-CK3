 galicia2.0080.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Until more recent times, cremation was viewed negatively by many Christian sects as it was seen as a sign of disrespect to God’s creation, and that it would interfere with physical resurrection of the body. Despite this, after their Christianization, cremation was still practiced among many Slavic peoples; sometimes, it appears to have been practiced alongside more accepted forms of Christian burial as well. For instance, in the border frontier of [GetTitleByKey('d_mazovia').GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] and the Rus, inhabited by West and East Slavs, there is archaeological evidence that both cremation and inhumation were practiced well into the 13th century. In this region, increased evidence for inhumation is hypothesized to even be linked to immigration of Christian populations from elsewhere."

 galicia2.0081.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Starting around the 12th and 13th centuries, a unique form of architecture emerged in [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_galicia_volhynia_region').GetName] that blended both older Rus styles of architecture, and the Romanseque style that dominated much of Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is hypothesized that architects and artisans from Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were patronized by local elites and played a major role in the development of this tradition. For instance, some of the first known buildings of this tradition are the 4-pillar Church of the Savior (second half of the 1140s) and the Assumption Cathedral (around the turn of 1140-1150s) in [GetTitleByKey('c_halych').GetNameNoTier], whose construction is possibly attributable to Polish artisans."

 galicia2.0082.desc:0 "While [Glossary( 'cochineal', 'COCHINEAL_GLOSS' )] is one of the more profitable exports from my territories, there is one issue with it: it can only be produced during a certain part of the year, typically within a narrow timeframe in summer, when larvae from the cochineal insect can actually be harvested. There are never large quantities of cochineal to go around, contributing to its high price.\n\nThe foreign envoy who is visiting me today, however, does not understand this. Our conversation had drifted to the topic of cochineal, and while this envoy does not place the blame on the people who produce it, he scoffed at merchants who deal in cochineal, claiming they are a cunning lot who have to be afforded special treatment because of how difficult it is to acquire good cochineal from them."

 galicia2.0083.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Ibn Fadlan was a 10th century Arab explorer who traveled through parts of Eastern Europe as part of an embassy sent by the Abbasid Caliphate to the king of Volga Bulgaria. The quotes in this event come from his account of the Rus people. In part of this account, he describes in detail the funeral of a Rus chieftain he witnessed, which included cremation and the ritual killing of one of the chieftain’s slave girl. Supposedly, during the funeral, Ibn Fadlan’s Rus interpreter laughingly told him that “you Arabs are fools,” because “you take the people who are most dear to you and whom you honor most and put them into the ground where insects and worms devour them. We burn him in a moment, so that he enters Paradise at once.”"

 south_ethiopia.0094.desc:0 "Although we [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun] have traditionally allowed for and encouraged each person in our society to own their own land, the community also provides communal land. Called #italic dannawu baato#!, it is used for collective grazing, and as spare land for young couples or newcomers who might not have the resources to get their own land yet.\n\nBecause this communal land is always changing, community leaders, such as myself, have to sit down in councils every now and then – such as what I am doing today – to determine the use and distribution of this communal land."
 south_ethiopia.0094.a:0 "Let the others in the council decide what to do"
 south_ethiopia.0094.b:0 "Use my status to influence others’ decisions"

 south_ethiopia.0095.desc:0 "Today, I am enjoying some #italic kocho#!, bread made from cooked, fermented enset. It’s a simple but delicious part of our traditional [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] cuisine, and fills me up quite a bit especially as I’m eating it together with some meat and spices."
 south_ethiopia.0095.a:0 "A good and nutritious dish!"
 south_ethiopia.0096.t:0 "Planting Enset Trees"
 south_ethiopia.0096.desc:0 "Recently, some of my servants have proposed to me that we plant some more enset trees around my residence. Besides being a good food source, their survivability and resistance to drought means that they make for reliable shade, emergency food, and an extra small level of security to deter any would-be intruders."
 south_ethiopia.0096.a:0 "Good idea! Go plant some enset trees."
 south_ethiopia.0096.b:0 "No, we don’t need to do this right now."

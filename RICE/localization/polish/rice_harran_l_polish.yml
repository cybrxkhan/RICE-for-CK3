I can still make out the words of Plato carved into its wood: “He who knows his own essence becomes divine.”\n\nI read the quote a few times, before looking up to the increasingly dark sky. I gaze at the stars, pretending I could somehow read our fate, before I find my way home."
 harran.0061.a:0 "I am [ibn_nabhan.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], last scion of Harran's ancient pagans."
 harran.0061.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Ibn Nabhan (1020 or 1024 to 1118 CE) was one of the last known descendants of the famed, 9th century Harranian pagan scholar Thabit ibn Qurra. He is known for his account of his grandfather Hilal's conversion to Islam several years before his birth.\n\nRICE's event chain for Ibn Nabhan is a semi-plausible but ultimately fictitious way to convert to Harranism for this later start date. In reality, he was likely a devout Muslim, or at least one who went through the trouble of emphasizing his family's embrace of Islam in his writings, perhaps to address any suspicions that their conversion was not genuine."
 harran.0062.t:0 "The Visitor"
 harran.0062.desc:0 "I sit in the darkness of my library, sipping mint tea as my acquaintance enters the room. He is a scholar from the House of Wisdom who I worked with back when I lived in Baghdad, and he gives a smile as he joins me. I offer him some tea, and we chat pleasantly about various topics to catch up.\n\nEventually, our conversation drifts towards the topic of religion. "I heard something interesting about your grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.GetFullName] the other day," my friend tells me.\n\nThis again? I shift uncomfortably, but don't say anything yet, and continue sipping my tea."
 harran.0062.a:0 "My own lack of piety isn't exactly news to him."
 harran.0063.t:0 "Hilal's Dream"
 harran.0063.desc:0 "“You have said for many years that your grandfather converted to Islam thanks to a dream, a sure sign from Allah himself.” My friend smiles. "One of my mentors, an older gentleman, who was acquainted with your grandfather, said he never heard of such a thing, but admits perhaps his memory is not as it used to be thanks to old age. I don’t doubt you, but it does make me wonder if your grandfather was telling the truth - no offense to him.” \n\nI stroke my chin and gaze at my friend quietly. Many question my grandfather's story. I know this.\n\nI ponder how to respond."
 harran.0063.a:0 "“The story is true, my friend! My grandfather was a true believer.”"
 harran.0063.a.tooltip:0 "You remain a true follower of the [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [faith|E], and will never be tempted to explore the ancient ways of your forefathers."
 harran.0063.b:0 "“Well…. I think my grandfather was a true believer, but….”"
 harran.0063.b.tooltip:0 "You admit you have some internal doubts regarding your grandfather's conversion away from your forefathers' [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs. Perhaps you might explore these beliefs more in the future...."
 harran.0064.t:0 "A True Believer?"
 harran.0064.desc:0 ""Perhaps my mentor misremembered due to old age," my acquaintance shrugs. "I don't mean to question your own faith, of course. I just thought it was something interesting. No matter, I am probably  making you uncomfortable, so I apologize."\n\n"Of course," I say politely. We sip tea for a few more moments, savoring the taste, before I continue: "Now, not to change the subject, but have you read the new treatise written by….""
 harran.0064.a:0 "We chat for several hours before my acquaintance leaves."
 harran.0065.t:0 "A True Believer?"
 harran.0065.desc:0 "“But what?” he says.\n\nI frown.\n\n"I don't mean to imply he was secretly an apostate, but…." I consider my words carefully. "I always felt he had sympathy for his birth religion. I could tell by the way he talked fondly of our ancestors."\n\n"The scholarly achievements of Harran's pagans are nothing to laugh at! Your forebear, [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFullName], was a rare scholar of his age." My friend nods. "But if your grandfather's heart is genuine, thanks to that dream, then that is all that matters. Sure, you still have a few wayward relatives who still believe your old gods, and I know you were never the most pious man, but at least you are a believer, too, right?""
 harran.0065.a:0 "I pause again, before saying, "Of course.""
 harran.0065.tooltip:0 "You begin to wonder whether your grandfather's conversion was genuine, and, in turn, ponder deeply about your own [faith|E]. This will put you in a somber mood for some time, but perhaps you will find a way to resolve it in the future...."
 harran.0066.t:0 "Soul-Searching"
 harran.0066.desc:0 "Even though it’s been a while, the conversation I had with my scholar friend about my grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.GetFullName] still weighs heavily on my mind. After all, the profound dream is a common theme I hear in other, similar stories of religious conversion.\n\nI only vehemently argue for the sincerity of my grandfather's conversion, perhaps in denial about my own doubts about it, and my own faith.\n\nSince settling in Harran, I have on occasion looked through my family's archives. It is mostly dusty tomes of knowledge, some a century or two old, and a few from the now gone Neoplatonic Academy that once stood in Harran. Today, however, I was sorting through my grandfather desk when I came across a small locked chest I didn't recognize at first."
 harran.0066.a:0 "Wait a moment…."
 harran.0067.t:0 "Grandfather's Writings"
 harran.0067.desc:0 "I recognize the chest. My grandfather gave me its key, many years ago, right before he passed away, telling me to open it if I ever harbored doubts about my place in the universe. I retrieve the key and, with shaking hands, unlock the chest.\n\nMore papers. Of course.\n\nI skim through some of them, and realize these look like personal letters and thoughts my grandfather had about various matters… mostly religious in nature. They are laments about the decline of the [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith, and my grandfather’s own internal struggle as to where his loyalties were, spiritually."
 harran.0067.a:0 "Such somber writings! Perhaps I can examine them in more detail later"
 harran.0067.tooltip:0 "You now have access to a [decision|E] where you can try to resolve the dilemma you, as Ibn Nabhan, feel about your [faith|E]. What spiritual path will you choose? How will you honor the Harranians' ancient legacy, in the end?"
 harran.0068.opening:0 "To my grandson:"
 harran.0068.desc:0 "If you are reading this, then I am long gone. You are an intelligent, thoughtful man, worthy of your ancestors. Please realize the spiritual anguish I felt about my choice of religion - the new faiths of our friends and neighbors, or our forefathers' traditions?\n\nI worry that you, too, may have your doubts one day, so I prepared these writings, as well as my commentaries on various texts, to help guide you towards making the right decision - whatever you choose.\n\nFirst, I suggest you look at my commentary on Plato, which concerns his text on…."
 harran.0068.a:0 "Thank you, grandfather. I will study these writings."
 harran.0068.tooltip:0 "You will spend time reading and contemplating your grandfather's writings, to seek answers that you hope will address your spiritual turmoil."
 harran.0069.t:0 "The Choice"
 harran.0069.desc:0 "After spending weeks studying the writings and commentaries on various texts my grandfather had left for me, I now have a better understanding of my internal conflict, for it was the same one he felt. My esteemed ancestors earned great influence through their status as learned [hilal_al_sabi.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scholars, but there is less interest in its lineage nowadays. Even the Neoplatonic Academy in Harran is no more.\n\nI have contemplated this matter deeply, and discussed my decision with my family. I know there may be consequences to this, but I have decided that deeply in my heart, I feel a closer bond towards…"
 harran.0069.a:0 "The true, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] creed, which I will continue to believe in as I always had."
 harran.0069.a.tooltip:0 "The old ways of Harran are faded shadows of the past. You will continue to be a believer of the [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [faith|E], for now."
 harran.0069.b:0 "The ancient [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs of my ancestors, which I will now adopt."
 harran.0069.b.tooltip:0 "Though Harran's pagans are few, they must be proud, and endure! You will learn all you can from the [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] spiritual and philosophical texts, in order to be able to practice their authentic pagan religion, for it is now your religion, too."

 harran.0080.desc:0 "For many centuries, the pagans of Harran have often gone to the nearby oasis of Sumatar Harabesi to pray to one of their chief gods, the moon deity Sin. Even now, there are still many idols and altars there. The Harranians have recently gone there for a major ceremony, which went by without incident."
 harran.0080.a:0 "So it is."

 harran.0083.t:0 "Beehive Buildings"
 harran.0083.desc:0 "The people of Harran have many distinct traditions that set them apart from others. For example, since time immemorial they have lived in houses shaped like beehives. Today as I pay a visit to the local leadership of Harran, I enter one of these houses belonging to a Harranian nobleman to discuss matters. It is the largest of its kind, and more a mansion."
 harran.0083.a:0 "Fascinating buildings! They are beautiful."
 harran.0083.b:0 "These are just ordinary, what’s the fuss?"
 harran.0084.t:0 "Festival to Tammuz"
 harran.0084.desc:0 "For millennia, one of the major festivals held by the pagans of Harran is the festival of Tammuz, where they lament their deity Tammuz - also identified with the Greek Adonis - who dies every year. They would make a public show of their grief, weeping and mourning. This year's festival has been considered an unusually successful one, inspiring the local pagans to work hard and live in peace and harmony."
 harran.0084.a:0 "Interesting."
 harran.0084.b:0 "Heathen blasphemies!"
 harran.0085.t:0 "Furthering Knowledge"
 harran.0085.desc:0 "The Neoplatonic Academy in Harran continues to prove its importance to learning and science. Several notable Harranian scholars and philosophers have recently published a number of texts expounding on various intellectual topics, which have been applauded throughout the region for their clear-sighted wisdom and illuminating nature."
 harran.0085.a:0 "Good news!"
 harran.0086.t:0 "Different Pagans in Harran"
 harran.0086.desc:0 "Outsiders often do not distinguish between the different kinds of pagans living in the city of Harran. There are the more educated elites, associated with the Neoplatonic Academy, who consider themselves heirs to the ancient philosophers like Plato or Plotinus. Then there are the common masses, who prefer to worship the gods like Sin, Tammuz, and Hermes in what the elites consider a superstitious manner.\n\nToday, while hosting one of the scholars from the Academy for a small banquet, he laments what he considers is the uneducated, superstitious nature of some of Harran’s pagan peasants. To him, they give others the wrong impressions of pagans as a backwards religion, unfit to explore philosophical and spiritual questions in the current era."
 harran.0086.a:0 "At least you and your colleagues are fighting against ignorance!"
 harran.0086.b:0 "The peasant masses are birdbrains regardless of religion, no?"
 harran.0086.c:0 "Why look down on others? Pride is unbecoming of a wise scholar."
 harran.0087.t:0 "Academic Connections"
 harran.0087.desc:0 "Several members of the Neoplatonic Academy in Harran have returned home from a sojourn in foreign lands, where they exchanged knowledge with other scholars. They have also brought with them a number of contacts that may prove useful to me."
 harran.0087.a:0 "That is good to hear. Welcome home!"
 harran.0088.t:0 "Pagan Diversity"
 harran.0088.desc:0 "The longer I rule over Harran, the more I am amazed at the diversity within the pagans living here. They have survived century after century together, despite their differences in what they worship or how they worship. One would think that this would have led to frequent conflicts, but surprisingly these groups manage to get along - even if there is tension at times. In my discussions with their leaders, it seems that they realize their unique community is stronger and will better endure any hardships if they stick together."
 harran.0088.a:0 "A valuable lesson for us to learn from."
 harran.0088.b:0 "They are still misguided heathens, though."

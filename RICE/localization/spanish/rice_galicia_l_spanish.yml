If the cantiga was of good or excellent [cantiga_quality|E], you'll get a somewhat randomized [character_modifier|E] whose effects are based on the topic. Cantigas of excellent [cantiga_quality|E] can also be turned into [artifacts|E] via the [decision|E] to $RICE_galicia_promote_cantiga$, so that you can retain their effects permanently, along with other bonuses."

At a good or excellent level, you'll gain a [character_modifier|E] with randomized effects. At an excellent level, you'll gain access to another [decision|E], $RICE_galicia_promote_cantiga$, to make a book [artifact|E] out of the [cantiga|E].\n\nQuality is determined by several factors, including: your [skills|E]; your [traits|E]; whether you've composed cantigas before; and if your [culture|E] has the $tradition_RICE_galician_portuguese_poetry_name$ [tradition|E]."

The 1116-1117 uprising in Santiago was an attempt to oust the city’s first Archbishop, Diego Gelmírez - the culmination of years of local resentment against clerical authorities.\n\nWhen Gelmírez first came to power as bishop in 1100, he focused on centralizing ecclesiastical control and making the city a major center of pilgrimage. For instance, he enforced stricter rules on local clergy, and curtailed many locals’ rights (in their view, at least) in favor of the pilgrims. In particular, his renovation of Saint James’ tomb was seen as desecration to many locals, given it was supposedly built by the apostle’s disciples. Ultimately, locals felt like the city was no longer their home, and that it was now dominated by throngs of foreign pilgrims and the tyrannical, unworthy Gelmírez.\n\nIn 1116, the city’s patricians and local clergy formed a secret brotherhood against Gelmírez. During their subsequent uprising, many locals supported them in reclaiming local spaces “lost” to pilgrims.\n\nGelmírez himself was chased by a mob into the Cathedral’s bell tower, which they set on fire. He managed to escape, and after the rebellion’s failure, he remained in power in Santiago. He would continue his programme of expanding the Cathedral and encouraging further pilgrimage, but ultimately did not resolve the root issue of tensions with the locals. A more short-lived, second rebellion happened in 1136; it, too, resulted in no lasting changes."

When they went deep into the cave, they supposedly witnessed a mysterious group of people dancing around a great treasure, but before they could reach them, their torches went out and they were forced to retreat in the darkness.\n\nSome believe this man was foolish, as he clearly dared to steal the riches which belonged only to the #italic mouros#!, the ancient, underground spirits of [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_galicia_region').GetName]. For that, so they say, he paid the ultimate price."

She tried to hinder the Apostle many times, yet failed at every turn. She realized Saint James was no ordinary man; admitting her wrongs, she let him baptize her, and from that day forth she became a faithful follower of Christ.

The belief is that by experiencing struggles and hardships as a pilgrim, they will reform, repent for their sins, and return as changed men and women.\n\nHowever, the Way of Saint James goes through some of the territories I rule, so in these lands, there are oftentimes a high volume of these convicted criminals passing by.

It would be good to have the perspective of someone from afar around here, especially someone who has gone on such a famed pilgrimage.

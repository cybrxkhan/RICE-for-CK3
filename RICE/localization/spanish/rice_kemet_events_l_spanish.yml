 VIETkemet.0001.t:0 "Osiris' Festival"
 VIETkemet.0001.desc:0 "Today I've been traveling through a part of my realm. It appears, however, that a village I am about to come to is about to start celebrating a local feast in honor of the great Osiris! What a good stroke of luck, some of my companions say, to come across such a joyous occasion. What should I do now?"
 VIETkemet.0001.a:0 "I will watch the festivities from afar, as befits a person of high status."
 VIETkemet.0001.b:0 "I will disguise myself as a commoner and partake in the merriment."
 VIETkemet.0001.c:0 "How dare the villagers ignore me! Order them to stop the feast and serve me!"
 VIETkemet.0002.t:0 "Praise Osiris"
 VIETkemet.0002.desc:0 "I meet with the village elders, who are thrilled that I have arrived in their humble settlement. They say it is auspicious that I have come at this time.\n\nStanding atop a hill overlooking the village, I watch as the feast to Osiris proceeds. Some villagers take pigs with them and bring the animals before an altar of the god. They slit the throats of the unfortunate beasts, an offering no doubt to Osiris, before giving the carcasses to swineherds who take the bodies away.\n\nAfterwards, a great cheer erupts, as men and women begin to fill the village square, dancing and laughing and drinking. One villager, playing the flutes, happily skips around playing a lively tune, and the villagers begin to follow after him while singing praises to Osiris."
 VIETkemet.0002.a:0 "It is good to see the villagers happy like this."
 VIETkemet.0002.b:0 "Osiris shall be pleased with their offerings."
 VIETkemet.0003.t:0 "Praise Osiris"
 VIETkemet.0003.desc:0 "After changing into humbler clothes, my companions and I now look like ordinary if well-off travelers. The villagers are hospitable to us "travelers" and happily provide us accommodations. It is auspicious that we have come at this time, they say.\n\nStanding in the village square, in the midst of a throng of men, women, and children, I watch as the feast to Osiris proceeds. Some villagers take pigs with them and bring the animals before an altar of the god. They slit the throats of the unfortunate beasts, an offering no doubt to Osiris, before giving the carcasses to swineherds who take the bodies away.\n\nAfterwards, a great cheer erupts, as everyone begins to fill the village square to celebrate. I enjoy drinking good beer and dancing with the other villagers. Soon enough, one villager, playing the flutes, happily skips around playing a lively tune, and we all follow after him while singing praises to Osiris."
 VIETkemet.0003.a:0 "This is fun!"
 VIETkemet.0004.t:0 "The Festival Ends"
 VIETkemet.0004.desc:0 "Like all good things, the feast comes to an end. I had a wonderful time, and bid farewell to my new friends. Perhaps I shall return one day to enjoy the celebrations once more!"
 VIETkemet.0004.a:0 "What good fun! Praise be to great Osiris!"
 VIETkemet.0005.t:0 "A Gift of Garlic"
 VIETkemet.0005.desc:0 "In olden times, the people of Egypt valued that most wonderful and delicious vegetable, garlic. It pleased the Gods and was used to take oaths. Perhaps it would be a good idea to order large quantities of garlic to be distributed to the temples scattered across our realm!"
 VIETkemet.0005.a:0 "Yes, let's do it. Praise be to the Gods!"
 VIETkemet.0005.b:0 "No, we don’t have the resources to spare."
 VIETkemet.0006.t:0 "Palm Trees"
 VIETkemet.0006.desc:0 "The powerful men and women of ancient Egypt often planted palm trees not just for their dates, but to provide good shade in their palaces and temples. I feel as if it would be wise if I did the same to my residence and the nearby temples. If anything, I can show many my power and remind them of the splendor of the old Egyptians!"
 VIETkemet.0006.a:0 "Let us plant the trees, then!"
 VIETkemet.0006.b:0 "This seems vain and pointless."
 VIETkemet.0007.t:0 "An Amulet"
 VIETkemet.0007.desc:0 "[khnum_gifter.GetTitledFirstName] has given me a gift today, specifically a beautifully crafted amulet, made of gold, that is dedicated to the god Khnum. As controller of the Nile, he brings fortune to all and is not to be ignored."
 VIETkemet.0007.a:0 "Thank you! May it help me in this life."
 VIETkemet.0007.b:0 "I cannot accept such a fine gift!"
 VIETkemet.0008.t:0 "Tomb Raiders"
 VIETkemet.0008.desc:0 "Ill news! Lately it seems a crafty band of robbers have been breaking into various tombs nearby, desecrating corpses and making away with whatever riches they can find. How now will the dead be able to properly protect their descendants, much less live contentedly in the afterlife with Osiris? This is nothing but a shame!"
 VIETkemet.0008.a:0 "Hopefully local security will catch these brigands…"
 VIETkemet.0008.b:0 "We will provide some aid to protect any unplundered tombs."
 VIETkemet.0009.t:0 "The Dwarf Protector"
 VIETkemet.0009.desc:0 "In my dream I found myself in the darkness of night, surrounded by evil spirits. I was lost. I was scared. I fell to despair, I lost hope. But then came the god Bes, that dwarf-god of grotesque appearance, and I saw him as he took out his swords and knives and waved them like a soldier, to ward off the demons. I saw as he took out his musical instruments and played loud songs to frighten them. As I awoke, I felt at peace."
 VIETkemet.0009.a:0 "As he protected the Pharaohs of old, so has he protected me just now!"
 VIETkemet.0010.t:0 "Isfet Within Me"
 VIETkemet.0010.desc:0 "I feel that despite my many good deeds, there is still Isfet - evil - within me that must be purged, for I have certainly done sinful things as a ruler. If my heart is out of balance with Ma’at, then in the afterlife I will be devoured by the terrible beast Ammit and I will have no chance of a peaceful immortality. Thus, I desire to find a good sorcerer-priest, who knows how to alleviate this worry!"
 VIETkemet.0010.a:0 "I’ll visit the temple to ensure my place in the afterlife!"
 VIETkemet.0010.b:0 "On second thought, maybe I’m overreacting."
 VIETkemet.0011.t:0 "Ma'at Restored?"
 VIETkemet.0011.desc:0 "The sorcerer-priest understands my worries, and knows the right incantation for my situation. He thus begins to chant in my presence:\n\n"I am bringing the gods incense and natron.\nI want to expel the bad smell from your mouth.\nTherefore I come in order to expel the evil in your hearts.\nWith this I remove the Evil, Isfet, which clings to you.\nWith this I bring you Good.\nI present Justice, Maat, to you......""
 VIETkemet.0011.a:0 "I begin to feel relieved as my soul is cleansed."
 VIETkemet.0012.t:0 "A Heinous Crime"
 VIETkemet.0012.desc:0 "A heinous crime! The wretched criminal is brought before me, and few in my court can bear to look at the deviant, lawless, inhuman evil-doer. He will be punished severely for his deed, of course, that is without a doubt. I tell the man his sentence, and my guards take him away to execute him shortly.\n\nTo think he murdered a cat, even by accident! An unforgivable crime.\n\nLike the Pharaohs of old, we consider the cat sacred, particularly to the great Goddess Bast. Anyone who kills a cat, even accidentally, will be put to death immediately - Bast’s justice is swift and vengeful, and may the criminal’s blood be adequate satisfaction for her!"
 VIETkemet.0012.a:0 "Terrible!"
 VIETkemet.0013.t:0 "The Heretic's Curse"
 VIETkemet.0013.desc:0 "[aten_fearer.GetTitledFirstName] claims that while taking a walk today he was by himself and encountered the ghost of Akhenaten himself! This abominable heretic, an incompetent Pharaoh obsessed with the god Aten, caused much mayhem in old Egypt and was rightfully cursed by the priests once the old, true religion was restored. But this is not good news… has [aten_fearer.GetFirstName] been cursed as well?"
 VIETkemet.0013.a:0 "Better get to the priests quickly, dear friend, just in case!"
 VIETkemet.0014.t:0 "Shemzu is Pleased"
 VIETkemet.0014.desc:0 "I watch solemnly as the criminal is beheaded. Off goes his head, and his blood spills to the ground. Shemzu, the demon-god known as the Overthrower of the Wicked at the Block, must be pleased. They say when the condemned are executed, Shemzu throws their severed heads into a wine press and turns it into red wine."
 VIETkemet.0014.a:0 "Righteous red wine! I’ll have some later today."
 VIETkemet.0015.t:0 "Beer?"
 VIETkemet.0015.desc:0 "Like in old Egypt, beer is considered a drink of the masses, but wine is reserved for the wealthy. Yet recently I’ve started to acquire an interest in beer. It’s an acquired taste, sure, given that it is thick and full of solids compared to wine, and it is of course not becoming of an upper-class noble such as myself, but it makes me feel healthier and it isn’t too bad."
 VIETkemet.0015.a:0 "But I should restrain myself. I am not a peasant after all!"
 VIETkemet.0015.b:0 "Others’ opinions be damned! Beer is good for me and my soul!"
 VIETkemet.0016.t:0 "Ma'at Upheld"
 VIETkemet.0016.desc:0 "The peasants I rule over believe that no matter what hardships they face, even if due to my fault, my rule has maintained the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. They praise me for my efforts."
 VIETkemet.0016.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 VIETkemet.0017.t:0 "Ma'at Not Upheld"
 VIETkemet.0017.desc:0 "Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, the peasants I rule over believe that due to my style of rule, even if I have done them good, I unfortunately have been unable to maintain the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm."
 VIETkemet.0017.a:0 "They don't understand!"
 VIETkemet.0018.t:0 "A Lost Tomb"
 VIETkemet.0018.desc:0 "My guards and I were traveling in the desert nearby when we came across an old tomb, half-buried in the sand. We would have missed it had I not spotted some of its worn-out stones, arranged in a pattern.\n\nAfter we investigate it, we find some sort of ancient writing, and though it is too worn to be legible, it is clear that it was made by one of the ancient Egyptian or Nubian cultures of this land. Furthermore, it is also evident that this was the burial place of someone important from ancient times, even if the site is now bare and desolate - perhaps not a Pharaoh, for example, but at least a man or woman of some importance."
 VIETkemet.0018.a:0 "I’ll pay my respects here, before moving on."
 VIETkemet.0018.b:0 "There isn’t much left… but can we loot something?"
 VIETkemet.0019.t:0 "Dedun's Protection"
 VIETkemet.0019.desc:0 "As a new shipment of incense arrives at my residence, to be used in various ceremonies and rituals of worship, I remember to think of Dedun, the old god of incense, who was popular in the borderlands of Egypt and Nubia in ancient times."
 VIETkemet.0019.a:0 "His flame shall protect me when I light incense at home."
 VIETkemet.0020.t:0 "Honoring Dedun"
 VIETkemet.0020.desc:0 "I am visiting a nearby temple when I see a man sitting in a corner, using small instruments and scales to measure what appears to be incense. When I ask him about what he is doing, he tells me firmly, “It is my duty to weigh the monthly rations of incense sent to the shrines and altars associated with this temple, and the priests who work there. My work honors Dedun, the god and lord of incense, and is essential. Please, let me focus.”"
 VIETkemet.0020.a:0 "Very well. Please continue with your important work."
 VIETkemet.0020.b:0 "Don’t be so cold. Remember who you are speaking to!"

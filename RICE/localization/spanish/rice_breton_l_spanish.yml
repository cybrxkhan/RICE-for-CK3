 breton.0020.t:0 "Preparing for the Tro Breizh"
 breton.0020.desc:0 "They say that any Breton who doesn't finish the Tro Breizh pilgrimage will suffer in the afterlife, having to complete it then. It is about time I did this pilgrimage! While it is not as prestigious nor rigorous as traveling to Jerusalem, for instance, it is an important part of our heritage."
 breton.0020.a:0 "I gather my belongings make preparations."
 breton.0021.t:0 "The Tro Breizh Begins"
 breton.0021.desc:0 "The day has come. It is time to begin the Tro Breizh pilgrimage! I will thus travel to the seven towns of the founding saints of Brittany and gain much piety in doing so."
 breton.0021.a:0 "First is Quimper, Saint Corentin's town."
 breton.0022.t:0 "Quimper"
 breton.0022.desc:0 "The rustic town of Quimper isn't as elegant nor extravagant as I would've wished, but it certainly has a certain charm. The conservative folk here are very spiritual, and the religious atmosphere is a good start to my pilgrimage.\n\nI make way to the church of Saint Corentin to pray and reflect. He was the first bishop of this town, and it is said that he had a miraculous fish whose parts would regrow, thus allowing him to sustain himself for as long as he needed. After I pray, but before I leave Quimper, I'll make sure to enjoy the local cuisine!"
 breton.0022.a:0 "Tomorrow I head for Saint-Pol-de-Léon."
 breton.0023.t:0 "Saint-Pol-de-Léon"
 breton.0023.desc:0 "Saint-Pol-de-Léon is a lovely seaside town blessed with picturesque beaches and the refreshing ocean air. There are an unusual amount of vegetables and fruits growing here, which is unsurprising giving the stories surrounding Saint Paul Aurelian, the great saint of this town.\n\nIt is here where Saint Paul Aurelian established an important monastery. He had an interesting habit of refusing to eat meat, and is said to have lived to almost a century and a half. Perhaps I should honor his temperance somehow, before I leave for Tréguier."
 breton.0023.a:0 "I'll refuse to consume any kind of meat while at Saint-Pol-de-Léon!"
 breton.0023.b:0 "No meat? That doesn't sound like a good idea. Being here is enough."
 breton.0024.t:0 "Tréguier"
 breton.0024.desc:0 "Tréguier is a seaside town like Saint-Pol-de-Léon but it is much busier. An important local port, it is often busy with commerce and trade. Perhaps this place is not always the best fit for a more contemplative, religious experience, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nTréguier is the town of Saint Tudwal, a renowned hermit and monastic, who was later made bishop of this town. I must practice his patience, as I wade through the throngs of pilgrims.\n\nAfter this, we go to Saint-Brieuc."
 breton.0024.a:0 "Observe the traders and see how business is doing while I'm here"
 breton.0024.b:0 "Converse with the cosmopolitan pilgrims and hear their stories"
 breton.0024.c:0 "Focus on spiritual matters, and pray at Saint Tudwal's Church"
 breton.0025.t:0 "Saint-Brieuc"
 breton.0025.desc:0 "Now I am at Saint-Brieuc, yet another harbor town. I am a bit tired of the busy towns I've recently come, and thankfully Saint-Brieuc offers refuge in its natural bay, a large reserve of green scenery against the blue waters below. As the locals told me, I can even see and hear hundreds and thousands of birds here, flourishing in this holy site.\n\nHere is the town of the great Saint Brioc, who founded the monastery that this town revolves around. I am lucky to be in the oratory he established, where I can lend myself to quiet prayer. A holy place indeed!"
 breton.0025.a:0 "My next destination after this is Saint-Malo."
 breton.0026.t:0 "Saint-Malo"
 breton.0026.desc:0 "I was a bit apprehensive about going to Saint-Malo at first. It is known as a rough neighborhood, where dwell pirates, rowdy seamen, and fearsome adventurers. But I realize this is only one part of the town - there are also normal people who live here, with good virtue, despite (or maybe because of) their surroundings.\n\nSaint-Malo's patron, Saint Malo, perhaps fits this town to some extent. A disciple of Saint Brendan (so I am told), he was said to have traveled and adventured the high seas with his master, reaching a mysterious land called the Blessed Isles. I wonder what heathens he converted on those isles?\n\nOnce I am done here, I will travel next to Dol."
 breton.0026.a:0 "Mingle with and understand the ne'er-do-wells - are they not God's children too?"
 breton.0026.b:0 "Stay on the quiet side of town. I prefer the company of pious, virtuous people."
 breton.0027.t:0 "Dol"
 breton.0027.desc:0 "Dol is a place filled with history. I heard it was here, for instance, that Saint Teilo was assigned by King Budric to slay a fearsome dragon that had terrorized the locals. How I wish I were there to see that battle! It must have been quite a spectacle, holy saint against evil dragon.\n\nIt was also here that Saint Teilo and Saint Dol planted the fruit groves that remain to this day. As I stroll under these trees, I cannot but help feel at ease in the midst of nature, God's creation. Not to mention the fruit they bear is delicious.\n\nAfter this, our journey is almost over - there is one last stop, in Vannes."
 breton.0027.a:0 "I should buy some of the tasty fruit while I'm here."
 breton.0027.b:0 "No need to buy the fruit - an unnecessary expense."
 breton.0028.t:0 "Vannes"
 breton.0028.desc:0 "I am almost finished with the Tro Breizh, for I now arrive in Vannes, the seventh and last stop on this pilgrimage. It is, despite being a very ancient settlement - dating to before the Roman Emperors, learned men tell me - a very joyous and exciting place as well. I found, for example, much amusement in the comically puffy, ugly granite statues the locals dub "Vannes and his Wife." Some of the locals also explained the lore of the ancient large stones that dot the area.\n\nBut this is a time for religion, not mirth. I reflect on the Saint of Vannes, Saint Patern. They say this Saint was a contemporary of the mighty King Arthur, the great Briton hero; he tamed the king's avarice and humbled the monarch according to the legends. At any rate, I too, must practice the virtues. This is why I went on this pilgrimage after all."
 breton.0028.a:0 "My journey is almost over."
 breton.0029.t:0 "Tro Breizh Ends"
 breton.0029.desc:0 "My old residence looms on the horizon. I am home, having finished the traveling to the seven holy sites across Brittany, a duty all good Christians in Brittany must follow undoubtedly. I have reflected on much through this pilgrimage, and seen the spiritual wonders of our land, and our religious heritage."
 breton.0029.a:0 "May I remember what I've experienced for as long as live."

 breton.0050.t:0 "Merlin's Tomb"
 breton.0050.desc:0 "There is a forested area under your rule in Brittany that is associated with Arthurian legend. Local Breton folklore claims there are several locations of note here, in particular the tomb of Merlin. Out of curiosity, you visit the location today, and find it is nothing more than a large carved rock in a small clearing in the woods. Could this really be where King Arthur's legendary court wizard, Merlin, lies buried? They say that if a simple offering like flowers or a bit of food is left by the rock, one can ask for a wish to come true."
 breton.0050.a:0 "A silly superstition! But the area seems peaceful, so I'll relax here."
 breton.0050.b:0 "I’m honored to visit the tomb of such a great man. I will offer flowers."
 breton.0051.t:0 "Stones of Carnac"
 breton.0051.desc:0 "In Brittany, ancient slabs of stones arranged in neat patterns can be found throughout, particularly near the village of Carnac. Some locals have been using such stones in our jurisdiction for local construction projects. There are those, however, who caution against such things, claiming these stones were built by ancient holy men, and should not be disturbed."
 breton.0051.a:0 "Let the commoners do with them as they wish."
 breton.0051.b:0 "Perhaps I can use the stones in my own projects!"
 breton.0051.c:0 "True, we should not disturb such sacred sites!"
 breton.0052.t:0 "Giants' Stones"
 breton.0052.desc:0 "While traveling in Brittany, I come across a site containing a vast amount of large stones, neatly arranged. I notice a shepherd letting his sheep rest under one such stone, and I strike a conversation with him. According to the stories he heard, he tells me, these stones were supposedly built by an ancient race of giants who lived here and once did battle with the knights of King Arthur."
 breton.0052.a:0 "Ha! That sounds like some fanciful story that a washed up bard made up."
 breton.0052.b:0 "That's plausible. Many Breton places are connected with Arthurian legend."
 breton.0053.t:0 "Eagle Fern"
 breton.0053.desc:0 "The eagle fern is a plant that can be found in much of Europe, but the Bretons in particular see it as full of mysterious powers if utilized correctly. Some of my Breton servants have told me tales of how men or women have accumulated great supernatural powers by gathering fern spores and placing it in their mouths - powers which range from invisibility to helping one locate treasures or learn secrets that others hide. At the least, it would provide me with good luck.\n\nThese servants have offered to help me collect some ferns growing nearby which we could use to make some sort of herbal concoction."
 breton.0053.a:0 "Mystical powers or not, I can always use some extra luck!"
 breton.0053.b:0 "This is pointless. Rational people trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], not superstition."
 breton.0053.c:0 "How ludicrous! Why stuff some weeds in one's mouth?"
 breton.0054.t:0 "Golden Grass"
 breton.0054.desc:0 "In Brittany, there is a rare, elusive plant known as golden grass, or 'aour iaotenn.' It is difficult to find and can only be discovered by someone who is virtuous, according to the legends. At any rate, a local Breton peasant known for her virtue has, supposedly, found some of this golden grass, and offers it to me. Consuming it as a potion will supposedly increase the strength tenfold."
 breton.0054.a:0 "Maybe not by tenfold, but it’s true the right herbs can be effective!"
 breton.0054.b:0 "I don't think that's golden grass.... This looks like an herb known as..."
 breton.0055.t:0 "Grass of Oblivion"
 breton.0055.desc:0 "I was outside, taking a walk in a field - an ordinary meadow like any other in my territories in Brittany - when I got lost in a most peculiar manner. That morning, I recall stepping on some sort of plant I did not recognize. The next thing I know, I'm standing in another part of the field a mile or two away, and the sun is setting as my guards and servants call out to me in alarm I must have been in some sort of daze, as I don't recall what happened!\n\nWhen I tell everyone what happened, one of my servants, an elderly Breton man, nods sagely and tells me I must have stepped on the Grass of Oblivion - according to local folklore, it is a rare but dangerous plant. Stepping on it will make one lose one's sense of direction and wander aimlessly."
 breton.0055.a:0 "I… think I will avoid taking a walk here from now on."
 breton.0056.t:0 "Breton Seafood"
 breton.0056.desc:0 "I am hosting an esteemed foreign traveler from a faraway land today, and hosting a small feast in his honor. At the banquet are various delicacies and dishes from the lands I rule, including the famed seafood from the coasts of Brittany. It seems my guest is really enjoying the Breton oysters, scallops, and mussels in particular!"
 breton.0056.a:0 "Be sure to eat it with our local salt from Guérande!"
 breton.0057.t:0 "An Old Breton Man"
 breton.0057.desc:0 "I was drinking out late at night with two of my favorite servants. As the three of us walk home, we spot an old man on a rickety old cart. My servants, still intoxicated, throw stones at the cart, breaking one of the axles. They laugh and tell me to join in, but I feel something's not right. What's an old man like that doing in the middle of the night?"
 breton.0057.a:0 "That behavior is uncalled for! I'll help the old man fix his cart."
 breton.0057.b:0 "Run away! Who knows what this suspicious person might be up to?"
 breton.0057.c:0 "I think it's best we ignore the man and just move on."
 breton.0058.t:0 "Ankou"
 breton.0058.desc:0 "This morning my two favorite servants were found dead of natural causes (apparently, I was told). What more, a large patch of my hair somehow turned white. I just know it had to do something with that mysterious old man I met yesterday....\n\nWait, heavens protect me! I know who that old man was, it was Ankou, the henchman of death who haunts Brittany!"
 breton.0058.a:0 "No one must know of what happened."
 breton.0059.t:0 "Chouchen Mead"
 breton.0059.desc:0 "As I am drinking chouchen - Breton variety of honeymead - with some local dignitaries, one of them suggests adding some bee venom into it to increase it's intoxicating effects. "I've tried it before, in one of the smaller villages," he claims. "It is an extraordinary experience!""
 breton.0059.a:0 "Are you insane? This is strong enough for me."
 breton.0059.b:0 "Yes, I like the sound of that. Let's find some bee venom!"
 breton.0060.t:0 "Breton Crepes"
 breton.0060.desc:0 "We have some guests from afar coming tonight, and I wish to serve them some of the finest Breton crepes. Should we serve them sweet or savory?"
 breton.0060.a:0 "Sweet"
 breton.0060.b:0 "Savory"
 breton.0060.c:0 "Why not both?"
 breton.0061.t:0 "Bugul Noz"
 breton.0061.desc:0 "I am at a local tavern, resting and enjoying some good food and drink. There is a bard present tonight, and he is telling various Breton tales. One concerns a being known as the Bugul Noz (the “Night Shephard”) who dwells in the forests of Brittany. Though he is hideous in appearance - in fact, so hideous that some die of fright upon seeing him - he is actually a very gentle and kind soul, the very image of benevolence. Because of this, whenever anyone is nearby, he will cry out and tell them to leave, so that they do not frighten themselves and they can go home safely. In a way, he thus helps people avoid dangerous areas at night."
 breton.0061.a:0 "That creature must be extremely ugly - I hope to never see it!"
 breton.0061.b:0 "What a tragic figure, who must live alone despite his compassion."
 breton.0062.t:0 "The Legendary City of Ys"
 breton.0062.desc:0 "A starving, ragged Breton sailor recently washed ashore in a nearby village. He was apparently part of the crew of a merchant ship that sunk in a storm recently, and it is likely he is the only survivor.\n\nI happened to be visiting this village at the time, and decided to pay him a visit. While we chatted about his experience, he claims that as he was being swept around the tempestuous waves as the ship sank, he saw the ruins of the city of Ys underneath the waters. According to Breton legend, Ys was a legendary and prosperous city on Brittany’s coast that was later swallowed by that ocean."
 breton.0062.a:0 "I wonder if it was a hallucination or the real thing...."
 breton.0063.t:0 "Too Much Salted Butter?"
 breton.0063.desc:0 "It seems I’ve stocked up on a lot of salted butter as of late. The local cuisine of Brittany has always relied on salted butter, perhaps to an excessive degree, but one can’t deny that it’s a great accompaniment to any kind of food."
 breton.0063.a:0 "Sell off any excess salted butter we have"
 breton.0063.b:0 "Gift the salted butter to some local notables"
 breton.0063.c:0 "Save the butter for any upcoming feasts"

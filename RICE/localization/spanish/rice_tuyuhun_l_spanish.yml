Alas, this kingdom collapsed in the midst of the great wars between Tang China and Tibet.\n\nHowever, times are changing once more. Under my leadership, I have reunified large swaths of the region around Lake Qinghai that were once controlled by our Tuyuhun forebears. Many local chieftains have sworn allegiance to me, and the might of the Tuyuhun people grow by the day - once more, we shall be a power to be reckoned with!

There are those in my court who say continuing this tradition will enhance the august majesty I exude, and evoke respect and admiration for any who visit my court. There are several craftsmen in the area who are eager to put their hard work to use on such a project."
 tuyuhun.0050.a:0 "A golden throne is what I need - commission one straight away."

 tuyuhun.0051.t:0 "Qinghaicong Horses"
 tuyuhun.0051.desc:0 "We have a visiting envoy from afar. I’ve decided to show him my stable of horses.\n\nSince the time of our progenitor, Murong Tuyuhun, we Tuyuhun have been renowned for our ability to breed the famed Qinghaicong horse - “descendants of the dragon” as the Chinese call it. Few can travel so far in so short a time as these horses, and the envoy’s eyes are alight with admiration when he sees these majestic horses.\n\n“You and your people must be proud of these horses,” he tells me, clearly impressed as he observes these horses out in the open fields."
 tuyuhun.0051.a:0 "It is but a blessing from heaven, after all."
 tuyuhun.0051.b:0 "It is why we’ll endure as a prosperous people."
 tuyuhun.0052.t:0 "The Great Translators"
 tuyuhun.0052.desc:0 "Centuries ago, the Tuyuhun were renowned for their skill as translators, and would often serve as intermediaries for the various states in the region, from the fleeting Chinese rulers of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, to the Hephthalite warlords of Central Asia. Though times have changed, a few of our people still hold onto these important linguistic traditions. It seems the translators who I have in my employ are continuing this tradition, as their skills have been acknowledged by quite a number of foreign visitors."
 tuyuhun.0052.a:0 "I am glad my translators are more than sufficient!"
 tuyuhun.0052.b:0 "We should organize them to instruct future translators."
 tuyuhun.0053.t:0 "Dancing Horses"
 tuyuhun.0053.desc:0 "The famed horses of the Tuyuhun were not only bred for war, but also for entertainment. Today, several distinguished guests are visiting me from afar, and during the small welcome picnic, I am entertaining them with our so-called dancing horses. Even in China, these horses were in high demand for centuries, and it is clear why. My guests are in awe as they witness the horses display their physical skills in the meadow."
 tuyuhun.0053.a:0 "Wasn't that spectacular?"
 tuyuhun.0054.t:0 "Barley Wine"
 tuyuhun.0054.desc:0 "While visiting an acquaintance of mine, he offers me a substantial feast consisting of a number of foodstuffs typical of a Tuyuhun meal. These include pickled cabbage, buttered noodles, boiled pork and lamb, and more. It is said that guests bring one luck in Tuyuhun culture, so treating them well will only reinforce that. As I am eating this delicious food, he also offers me some traditional, homemade Tuyuhun barley wine."
 tuyuhun.0054.a:0 "Thank you! Let’s make a toast!"
 tuyuhun.0054.b:0 "No thanks, I won’t drink alcohol today."
 tuyuhun.0055.t:0 "Counting Livestock"
 tuyuhun.0055.desc:0 "I am visiting an acquaintance of mine and notice that he has quite a number of livestock, mainly the famed Tuyuhun horses as well as some yaks and sheep. It’s quite a number, so on instinct I start counting out loud how many he has. As soon as I do so, however, one of my guards tells me to stop. It’s a superstition among the Tuyuhun that counting the number of livestock that belong to someone else will bring them misfortune."
 tuyuhun.0055.a:0 "Ah, I almost forgot! It’s good you reminded me."
 tuyuhun.0055.b:0 "Misfortune, you say? I never liked this person anyways."
 tuyuhun.0056.t:0 "Brick Carving"
 tuyuhun.0056.desc:0 "Brick carving is a traditional art of the Tuyuhun people, one we acquired when we first settled in the hills of the Qinghai region.

He says he can renovate a part of my residence with new brick carvings that will beautifully depict various creatures, such as dragons, phoenixes, birds, and fishes, as well as flowers too."
 tuyuhun.0056.a:0 "Sounds like a deal!"
 tuyuhun.0056.b:0 "I’m not interested in this."
 tuyuhun.0057.t:0 "The Horse Thief"
 tuyuhun.0057.desc:0 "A thief recently attempted to steal some Qinghaicong horses belonging to my government stables. He managed to flee a short distance before he was caught by my soldiers a few days later. For us Tuyuhun, who have a reputation as preeminent horse breeders and owners, stealing a horse is considered as heinous a crime as kidnapping or even murdering a person. Normally my officials would take care of the matter, but due to various circumstances I have an opportunity to make a ruling on the crime this time."
 tuyuhun.0057.a:0 "I'll trust my officials’ judgment and let them handle this."
 tuyuhun.0057.b:0 "Our traditions are clear. This is like murder - execute him."

 rhodes.0055.t:0 "Inspecting Lindos"
 rhodes.0055.desc:0 "I am presently on a routine inspection of the fortifications of the acropolis of Lindos, in [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier]. One can easily see why people have fortified this place over the centuries given its excellent defensible location. Here, it is common to see both ancient and contemporary structures, architecture, artwork, and ruins mix together freely in this location.\n\nI am now just passing by the stone relief of an ancient Rhodian trieme, a somewhat famous landmark among the locals. At the foot of Lindos’ acropolis, this beautiful and majestic artwork was carved centuries ago, and still looks relatively intact."
 rhodes.0055.a:0 "I, too, hope to defend the island as well as the ancients did."
 rhodes.0056.t:0 "Aspri Petra"
 rhodes.0056.desc:0 "The island of Kos lies a little north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier]. I don’t always get to visit, but I do come every now and then on official business and to enjoy the sights. Today, I was a little adventurous and hiked out of town to see a stone cave and rock formation called Aspri Petra. Not too many go to this place, so it is a nice spot to relax."
 rhodes.0056.a:0 "To imagine it’s been here, all this time, for eons…."
 rhodes.0057.t:0 "Mount Attavyros"
 rhodes.0057.desc:0 "The highest point on the island of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier] is known as Mount Attavyros. It is considered a site of great spiritual importance by some locals, and a few brave the arduous trek every now and then up to the peak. According to those who have been there, one can see many other islands in the Dodecanese from the peak on a clear day, but I have heard some claim they can even see Crete."
 rhodes.0057.a:0 "I doubt that’s possible, but I’m sure it is a nice place."
 rhodes.0057.b:0 "If only I had the time to go there! It must be amazing."
 rhodes.0057.c:0 "Why not go on a little excursion there? I’ll do it soon!"
 rhodes.0058.t:0 "Kalymnian Sponge Economy"
 rhodes.0058.desc:0 "The sponges harvested by the sponge divers from Kalymnos, north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier], are famous around the world, and they are always bringing the island great profit. However, lately, the sponge industry has not been doing as well, as the island has been selling less than usual."
 rhodes.0058.a:0 "I hope things change for them soon."
 rhodes.0059.t:0 "Kalymnian Sponge Economy"
 rhodes.0059.desc:0 "The sponges harvested by the sponge divers from Kalymnos, north of [rhodes_county.GetNameNoTier], are famous around the world, and they are always bringing the island great profit. However, lately, the sponge industry is doing even better and selling more than usual."
 rhodes.0059.a:0 "That’s good for the local economy!"

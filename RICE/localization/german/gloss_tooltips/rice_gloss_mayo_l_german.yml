 SCOTTI_GLOSS: "The Gaelic-speaking peoples, including the ancestors of the modern-day Irish, were called the #bold Scotti#! in late antiquity and the early medieval period. During this period, Ireland was known as #italic Scotia Maior#!, while Scotland was called #italic Scotia Minor#!. The association of the word Scot with Scotland, and not the Gaels overall or the Irish, would be a later medieval development."
 PERIPHYSEON_GLOSS: "The #bold Periphyseon#!, called the 'final achievement of ancient philosophy' is considered the magnum opus of John Scottus Eriugena, one of the most brilliant Christian intellectuals of the 9th century. It syncretizes and develops on the ideas of many different ancient strands of thought in a Christian context, to the point where it was condemend by some later Christian theologial authorities for promoting overly pantheistic and Neoplatonic ideals, even though Eriugena considered himself an orthodox opponent of heresy. The book is also known as #italic De divisione naturae#!, a Latin name given to it by the 17th century English antiquarian Thomas Gale who published the first printed version of the text."
 PANTHEISM_GLOSS: "#bold Pantheism#! is a religious or philosophical idea that God is identical to the universe, and typically does not see God as a distinct entity, anthropomorphic or otherwise."
 LORDS_OF_THE_WOOD_GLOSS: "In early medieval Ireland, twenty-eight trees found on the island were legally divided into four groups of seven, based on their economic and cultural significance. The #bold Lords of the Wood#! were considered the seven most important of these four groups, and consisted of oak, hazel, holly, yew, ash, Scots pine, and wild apple."
 NISI_FORTE_GLOSS: "#bold Nisi forte#! is a Latin phrase meaning 'unless, perhaps'. A famous usage of this phrase comes from the Roman statesman and lawyer Cicero; during his defense of the consul Lucius Licinius Murena, who stood trial after being accused of electoral bribery, Cicero said in his speech, “Nemo enim fere saltat sobrius, #italic nisi forte#! insanit.” (“No one dances sober, unless perhaps he is insane.”)"
 SAINT_PATRICKS_CHAIR_GLOSS: "#bold Saint Patrick's Chair#!, or the Boheh Stone, is a large stone located close to the old mountain and pilgrimage site of Croagh Patrick in Ireland, which contains various petroglyphs and man-made symbols on it. It may have been carved during the Neolithic era, and is one of the more remarkable examples of prehistoric or ancient monuments dotting the landscape around the mountain, proving the area's spiritual importance long before Ireland's Christianization. Twice a year, if one stands by Saint Patrick's Chair, the sun, when setting, appears to roll down the shoulder of the mountain, which may explain why the stone was originally carved or placed at its current location."
 SAINT_PATRICKS_BREASTPLATE_GLOSS: "#bold Saint Patrick's Breastplate#! is an Irish prayer traditionally attributed to Saint Patrick, though its first attestation dates to several centuries after his lifetime. A famous part of the prayer is the repeated invocation of Jesus Christ:#italic \n\nChrist with me, Christ before me,\nChrist behind me, Christ within me,\nChrist beneath me, Christ above me,\nChrist at my right, Christ at my left.#!"

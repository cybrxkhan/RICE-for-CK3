 SEA_NOMADS_GLOSS: "#bold Sea Nomad#! is a term applied to various ethnic groups in some parts of maritime Southeast Asia, who have traditionally, to varying extents, lived and traveled on boats and whose livelihoods depend greatly on the sea. These include the Orang Laut of Malaysia and Sumatra, the Moken on the border of Thailand and Malaysia, and the Sama-Bajau peoples of eastern Indonesia and the southern Philippines. Not all of these peoples are entirely nomadic or sea-based; some merely live by the coast and depend greatly on it. Regardless, historially, these peoples had close relations with kingdoms in the region; their skills were highly sought after, so they often served as mercenaries, pirates, merchants, and travel guides."
 GUNIG_GLOSS: "In the traditional beliefs of the Senoi peoples, a sub-category of the #italic Orang Asli#!, a collective term for the indigenes of peninsular Malaysia, #bold gunigs#! are spirit familiars who help people in various ways. Oftentimes, they find a #italic halaaq#! (also spelled #italic halaa#! or #italic halaa'#!), a ritual specialist somewhat analogous to a shaman, who they become attached to following a dream. Through this relationship, which is often seen as a rather intimate one, the #italic gunig#! can be summoned to protect or heal people, give advice, and assist in daily life."
 BAH_MALAYSIA_GLOSS: "Among the Aslian speakers of Malaysia, #bold Bah#! is typically a title of address reserved for men, often young men. At least in the modern day, it can have a mildly derogatory context as young men are seen as irresponsible and lacking in control."
 ORANG_ASLI_GLOSS: "#bold Orang Asli#! is a modern label given to the 18 indigenous ethnic groups of Peninsular Malaysia. These 18 ethnic groups are often further divided into three sub-groups:\n\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$#bold Senoi:#! Mainly slash and burn agriculturalists and the largest of the three\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$#bold Semang:#! Nomads who are “Negritos” (a term used to refer to various ethnic groups in SE Asia who superficially resemble Africans)\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$#bold Proto-Malays:#! Settled farmers and seen as similar to Malays proper and may be descended from earlier waves of Austronesian speaking migrants\n\nWhile these groupings and that of the Orang Asli in general are nebulous and have their issues, these groups do share a number of traits, like, famously, a pacifist worldview."
 AUSTROASIATIC_GLOSS: "The #bold Austroasiatic#! languages are one of the major language families of the world. They are spoken across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and parts of China and South Asia as well, and were historically probably more dominant in the region until the arrival of later waves of Austronesian and Tai speakers. The largest Austroasiatic language, with far more speakers than all other Austroasiatic languages combined, is Vietnamese, with over 86 million native speakers as of 2023. Other major Austroasiatic languages with an extensive written tradition and historical record include Khmer (with 19 million native speakers) and Mon (with 1.1 million native speakers). The rest of the Austroasiatic languages are spoken by various minority groups in the region."
 GARUDA_GLOSS: "#bold Garudas#! are mythical creatures depicted often as eagle-headed men that are found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain mythology, and the mythologies of cultures influenced by these religions. Typically, they "

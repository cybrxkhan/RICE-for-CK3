Even after the start of the year shifted towards other dates, it was still celebrated in Byzantine-influenced areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. By then, the holiday was simply known as Kalends, or Kalandai in medieval Greek, as the other Roman Kalends, i.e. starts of other months, were no longer celebrated. While Byzantine church authorities condemned the Kalends as a heretical pagan practice, it became a symbol of religious Christian identity for Orthodox Christians in Muslim lands. Either way, based on readings of Byzantine and Muslim sources, the Kalends appear to have declined in popularity and disappeared by the 13th or 14th centuries."

Yet others dislike such a thing, not wanting to mingle with such lowly types."

Our first records of Palios date back to the medieval period, though they may have had Roman-era antecedents. During Medieval and Renaissance eras, they were important religious and civic occasions, often associated with Saints' feast days. Most modern palios and equivalent horse races are recent inventions, or reinventions of older traditions. The oldest extant Palio, and the most famous one, is Siena's, whose modern form dates back to the 1633 CE. However, it is attested in a document as early as the 1239, where the palio's rules are discussed in some detail, suggesting it had already been run for years before that."

One of them chants a poem, while the three others sing as an accompanying chorus. It is a pleasant sound, and their songs touch on a vast repertoire of topics.\n\nAt the end of the performance, I dole out rewards for these talented singers, as to be expected."
 sardinia.0062.a:0 "Thank you for the excellent performance."
 sardinia.0062.b:0 "Such skilled singers deserve more than a simple gift!"
 sardinia.0062.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! #italic Cantu a tenore#! or #italic canto a tenore#! is a form of throat singing native to Sardinia, particularly its central regions, usually sung by a group of four men. They can be performed at both informal occasions, but also at formal gatherings too, such as weddings and religious festivals."

 sardinia.0063.desc:0 "Shepherds can be found all throughout [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_sardinia_region').GetName]. Recently, I have taken time to explore the so-called shepherds’ paths scattered throughout [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], winding through its rugged mountains, valleys, rivers, and more.\n\nIt was a relaxing excursion, and it is also important that I know potential roads that my officials and soldiers can take in the surrounding region."
 sardinia.0063.a:0 "This information will come in handy."

 sardinia.0064.desc:0 "While walking out in the countryside in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], we came across a small herd of #italic Giara#! horses. For as long as anyone can remember, one can find herds of these small wild horses on the island. They go free and travel where they please across the island’s rugged terrain, and are lovely to observe."
 sardinia.0064.a:0 "They may be small, but they’re still a majestic sight!"
 sardinia.0064.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The #italic giara#! horse is a breed of small horse found throughout Sardinia. It is uncertain whether they are an ancient breed native to the island, or descended from horses introduced to Sardinia by Punic or Roman colonists later on. Either way, for centuries, herds of wild #italic giara#! horses were attested throughout Sardinia. Presently, however, their population has dwindled to several hundreds, and they are restricted to a plateau region in southern Sardinia called #italic Giara di Gesturi#!."

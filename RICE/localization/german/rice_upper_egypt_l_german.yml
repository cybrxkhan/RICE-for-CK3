Several other deities were also present at the temple. Later, when Nubia was Christianized, the temple was reused as a church for some time.

Years ago, it was formally closed and abandoned, but that is changing thanks to the efforts of [temple_restorer.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n A devout [temple_restorer.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], [temple_restorer.GetFirstName] has taken efforts to restore the temple to its former glory and formally reopen it. Devotees to Mandulis and other deities are returning in droves to worship at this sacred house of worship."

 upper_egypt.0060.desc:0 "Hippopotamuses can be found up and down the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName]. Although their numbers have been dwindling in recent years, people still encounter them frequently, and these beasts are often ferocious and aggressive. It is always wise, they say, to stay clear of these hippopotamuses.\n\nAlas, one such hippopotamus recently went on a rampage in [county.GetNameNoTier]. It killed a large number of people before it was finally subdued by some brave local hunters and guards."

 upper_egypt.0061.desc:0 "Today I am doing an inspection of some of my territories along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName]. Specifically, I am traveling to see some of the rural countryside. Agriculture, after all, has been a major part of life along the Nile for centuries if not millennia, so it is important I ensure these farms will be able to produce an adequate supply of food.\n\nAnyways, I spend several hours talking with farmers and local officials about how the local irrigation networks are doing. We need to make sure these are always in good shape so that we may fully take advantage of the annual Nile flood."
 upper_egypt.0061.a:0 "A tedious but necessary bit of work."
 upper_egypt.0062.t:0 "Khirs"
 upper_egypt.0062.desc:0 "Recently, in [county.GetNameNoTier], a number of nomad pastoralists have moved in to take advantage of a type of land known as #italic khirs#!. These are areas along the Nile river that are not suitable for agriculture, because of the great amount of weeds present, and the lack of maintenance from local villagers to transform such territory into arable land.\n\nThat said, just because these villagers aren’t using these lands doesn’t mean they would happily welcome anyone in as their neighbors. There are rising tensions between the villagers and the pastoralists, and I need to handle the situation delicately."
 upper_egypt.0062.a:0 "Let the two sides sort it out themselves - it’s no concern of mine."
 upper_egypt.0062.b:0 "As long as the pastoralists cause no trouble, they are welcome."

 upper_egypt.0063.desc:0 "I am hearing a sermon by a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] who hails from my territories along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName].\n\nIn the sermon, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] talks about how [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] favors us, and this explains why the Nile flood happens, and how it is thanks to the grace of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] that we can harness the bounty of Egypt. When we honor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and follow the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religion, the Nile inundation is excellent; when we disappoint [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and commit sin, we get a poor Nile inundation to remind us to be humble and avoid sin. And so, without [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], we would have no crops to harvest along the Nile."
 upper_egypt.0063.a:0 "Verily, it is so! The food we get from the Nile is thanks to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

When I asked them what they were doing, they explained they were praying to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to ensure we would have a good inundation the next time the Nile flooded. After all, though having the Nile flood is predictable, the results of its inundation are not."
 upper_egypt.0064.a:0 "I need to get going, but I wish you the best."
 upper_egypt.0064.b:0 "Perhaps I can join you in your prayers?"
 upper_egypt.0065.t:0 "Nilometer Records"
 upper_egypt.0065.desc:0 "It has come to my attention that a scholar I am acquainted with recently compiled some information regarding the Nile inundation recently. Thanks to the Nilometers found all over the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName], we have relatively accurate records of how good the Nile flood was, going back centuries.\n\nI have thought about taking a little time off from my daily duties to study these records, and discuss the information contained therein with other local scholars. Perhaps this knowledge can offer me some insights on how to better manage my territories along the Nile."
 upper_egypt.0065.a:0 "Yes, this is important knowledge for a leader like me to have."

 upper_egypt.0066.desc:0 "Ancient monuments and grand structures built eons ago are a common sight along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName]. Some are large enough that they can be reused for various purposes even after they were long abandoned.\n\nAt any rate, according to a local official in [county.GetNameNoTier], villagers there have shown interest in using one such building, which appears to be some kind of old temple complex. These villagers intend to build houses, shops, and other necessary structures inside this temple to expand their village. The idea is that it would be efficient to make use of the temple walls, which are strong, sturdy, and have lasted for generations, instead of building randomly in some other place.\n\nHowever, although the village sits at a strategic location, it is not the wealthiest settlement out there, and it needs some assistance in order for this to happen."
 upper_egypt.0066.a:0 "By all means! I can financially support this endeavor."

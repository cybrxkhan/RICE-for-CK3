With that in mind, I make my way up the dirt path to another building, a pilgrim’s lodge which is next to a soup kitchen.

I have heard from some that this building was, supposedly, where Nasir Khusraw lived for many years, writing poetry and such. I also notice there are many cuts and smudges on the wall, evidence of writings that devout pilgrims have scrawled on here over the years.\n\nI finally enter the room which has Nasir Khusraw’s tomb.

This is all done in complete silence.\n\nIn the afternoon, everyone focuses on making sculptures out of flour. These will be baked and displayed out in the pastures early next morning to symbolize their migration to the fields to graze, before they are sold to non-believers as we are not allowed to eat them. Typically, the sculptures depict shepherds or various animals; what shall I focus on sculpting this year?"

After this tower of food is lit, we all hurry into the temple, to allow the ancestors time and space to visit. Inside the temple, an elder calls out, “Oh elders, come eat and drink, then leave.”\n\nOnce enough time has passed, we emerge from the temple.

Earlier, when we were organizing the Chawmos festival, what did we agree on would be the theme of this year’s performance?"

Foxes are cunning animals, who are responsible for a year’s fortunes and misfortunes. As part of this ritual, young men begin to scour the nearby hills and forests in the early morning for foxes, playing loud drums and music near the caves the foxes live in to entice them to come out. If the first fox they see runs uphill, to the pure abode of the mountains, then good fortune shall befall on all the following year; if it runs downhill, then there shall be misfortune. If no fox is found… then perhaps they were too clever for us this year."

While there is food and dance, there is one performance that takes center stage.\n\nIn the middle of the village square, many individuals have covered their faces. Not only that, many of them, masked or not, are dressed as the opposite gender: some men are dressed as women, and some women are dressed as men. Meanwhile, the men have been divided into two groups; the “pure” men sing solemn and honored songs of the past, while the “impure” men sing obscene melodies with wild rhythms. This, truly, is the culmination of the Chawmos: when the boundaries of the realms are broken down before they are rebuilt."

Some say this killed the tyrant, but many others say this merely weakened him, and he hides in one of these valleys, using foul magic to curse the population every now and then, which is why re-enacting this event is necessary."

 pamir.0224.desc:0 "While traveling in the regions of my realm dominated by Pamiri Iranians, our local guide stops us when we come across a #italic qadamgoh#!. These are places where local saints or holy people are said to have visited generations ago, and are typically indicated with a special marking on a grove of trees or a rock.

 pamir.0225.desc:0 "It is said that many, many generations ago, the kings of the Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains were some of the most devout Buddhists in the land, and traces of their influence can still be seen to this day. I was going to one of the local villages in the parts of my realm in the Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains, when I pass by an ancient rock carving depicting a Buddha."

 pamir.0226.desc:0 "I am at one of the larger Burusho villages of my realm in the Pamirs. The Burusho are a remote and distinct peoples, but the ones in my realm do work to establish a good relationship with me. For instance, I am currently visiting one of their shamans, or a #italic dayal#!. Once in a trance, he communicates with a #italic Pari#! (as fairies are called in this land), and the #italic Pari#! says it wants to give me some important advice from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 pamir.0226.a:0 "I politely decline the offer. Sounds blasphemous!"
 pamir.0226.b:0 "Very well! Please tell me what I must know."
 pamir.0227.t:0 "Is She a Belas?"
 pamir.0227.desc:0 "A girl from the villages of my realm is brought before me. Locals accuse her of being a #italic Belas#!, which, according to the folklore of the Pamirs, is the vengeful spirit of a living woman who attacks men and women she hates at night. The girl swears she’s innocent and that she’s being framed by her rivals. Her fiance has broken off their engagement, and she is ostracized by the village, which demands that she be punished."
 pamir.0227.a:0 "This superstitious stupidity is not my concern!"
 pamir.0227.b:0 "She must be innocent. Let her go, don't disturb her."

 pamir.0228.t:0 "Descendant of a Peri?"
 pamir.0228.desc:0 "While visiting one of the villages under my rule in the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains, the village headsman tells me a story about how his distant ancestor supposedly met and fell in love with a #italic Peri#!, the local name for a fairy spirit. She bore him several sons before disappearing. \n\n“I’m not sure if the story is true,” the gentleman says with a laugh, “but I like to think it is!”"
 pamir.0228.a:0 "It explains why you and your family are so charming!"
 pamir.0228.b:0 "True, it is probably just some fanciful fantasy."
 pamir.0229.t:0 "Legacy of the Hephthalites"
 pamir.0229.desc:0 "I am hearing local elders tell me tales of the great and mighty Hephthalites. The Hephthalite hordes once called the Pamir and Hindu  Kush Mountains their home, but now they are no more, a people whose numbers dwindled and have been absorbed by other cultures around them."
 pamir.0229.a:0 "They were feared warriors with few equals." 
 pamir.0229.b:0 "They were also traders and explorers, too." 
 pamir.0230.t:0 "A Village's Huk"
 pamir.0230.desc:0 "“Every land has its #italic huk#!, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip],” the village elder explains, patting my arm.\n\nI am in a village somewhere in the highlands of the Pamirs and Hindu Kush to conduct some official business. Right now, I’m on break and having small talk with a local elder.\n\nHe continues, “It means the spirit of the land in our tongue. #italic Huk#! can come from the water, or the soil. Everyone in the village, man and woman, young and old, shares its #italic huk#!. Differences in #italic huk#! explain why the people of our village are gentle, intelligent, and polite, but those of the village downstream are rude, brash, and angry.”"
 pamir.0230.a:0 "A wise observation about the #italic huk#!, dear elder."
 pamir.0230.b:0 "I visited the other village and they’re not like that!"
 pamir.0230.c:0 "This sounds like some silly peasant superstition."
 pamir.0231.t:0 "A Gorgeous Valley"
 pamir.0231.desc:0 "Though the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains can be cold and desolate, it has hidden beauty as well. As you travel one day in your territories, you come across a valley where the grass is of greenest color, full of blooming flower meadows, and there are a few lakes with water almost as blue as the sky. You gaze in awe at the vision of paradise before you, the kind one can only witness at the roof of the world."

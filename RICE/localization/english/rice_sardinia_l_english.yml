 activity_RICE_sardinia_palio_race_context_tooltip:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Palios, and similar practices such as the Sa Sartiglia in Sardinia, are a type of horse race in Italy. Our first records of Palios date back to the medieval period, though they may have had Roman-era antecedents. During Medieval and Renaissance eras, they were important religious and civic occasions, often associated with Saints' feast days. Most modern palios and equivalent horse races are recent inventions, or reinventions of older traditions. The oldest extant Palio, and the most famous one, is Siena's, whose modern form dates back to the 1633 CE. However, it is attested in a document as early as the 1239, where the palio's rules are discussed in some detail, suggesting it had already been run for years before that."

For as long as anyone can remember, one can find herds of these small wild horses on the island. They go free and travel where they please across the island’s rugged terrain, and are lovely to observe."

 sardinia.0064.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The #italic giara#! horse is a breed of small horse found throughout Sardinia. It is uncertain whether they are an ancient breed native to the island, or descended from horses introduced to Sardinia by Punic or Roman colonists later on. Either way, for centuries, herds of wild #italic giara#! horses were attested throughout Sardinia. Presently, however, their population has dwindled to several hundreds, and they are restricted to a plateau region in southern Sardinia called #italic Giara di Gesturi#!."

 game_concept_indian_ocean_pirate_desc:0 "The pirates and corsairs of the Indian Ocean are represented in several different ways in the game. First, rulers who meet certain conditions along the Indian Ocean can take a [decision|E] to construct a [special_building|E] called the Indian Ocean Pirate Den. It has a number of military and economic bonuses, and a few [counties|E] even have this building already in place at the start of the game, usually those who historically were famous for hosting pirates or working with them.\n\nThe island of Socotra gets a special variation of this [special_building|E] called the Bawarij Den, representing the feared Bawarij pirates, who were corsairs of Indian origin based on the island. Several of Socotra's mechanics even revolve around the Bawarij. For example, [rulers|E] of the [county|E] of Socotra can take a [decision|E] to Recruit Bawarij Outlaws during a war, bolstering their armies at the cost of a devastating negative [county_modifier|E]. They can also take a [decision|E] to form the [Kingdom|E] of Socotra if they have upgraded their Bawarij Den to an appropriate level.\n\nLastly, Bawarij Pirates may sometimes appear as [courtiers|E] via events. This is limited to [rulers|E] of Socotra, and [rulers|E] in the Indian Ocean whose dynasties have unlocked Cosmopolitan Ports in the Maritime Trade [dynasty_perk|E]. These are powerful, mighty men who often make excellent [knights|E] or [commanders|E]."

After all, it is not uncommon for ordinary merchants - like ones we do business with - to turn to piracy to make extra coin, nor is it unheard of for pirates to offer their services to enterprising lords. But previously, such things were done in an ad hoc, disorganized manner within our realm.\n\nNow, we have struck a deal with the local pirates. In exchange for letting them establish an official base in our territory, they will raid the shores of our foes on our behalf and provide us a share of the loot, as well as support us in our military ventures. There is no shame in associating with pirates; it is merely another tool we have in our arsenal to protect our economic and political interests in the ever dynamic, dangerous world of the Indian Ocean."

Our poets are not direct and assertive like the poets of our Arabic-speaking cousins, for we focus more on subtleties and hidden meanings, secret symbols and clever twists of fate. Poetry is embedded deeply into our culture - it is sung by peasants working in the field and butchers as they slaughter sheep, by warriors as they charge into battle and holy men as they give sermons.\n\nNow, I have decided to host a major poetry competition in [capital_province.GetName]! Which man or woman will prove themselves the worthiest of poets this year?"

These men and women improvise original poem after poem off the top of their heads on various topics provided by the judges. Some are humble, humorous little anecdotes, others are tales about good versus evil, but most use the veiled language - here, words do not always mean what they mean, for the best poets hide true meaning behind clever symbols or plot twists.

 socotra.0024.desc.winner_3:0 "He is a former sailor, an old veteran of the seas who settled nearby. His voice is coarse, sure, but that only gives a time-worn and ancient flair to his poem. No doubt some of his more vivid ideas are informed by the exotic, faraway lands he visited as a strapping young man.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_4:0 "She is an herbalist and a wisewoman, kind and helpful to all. Though she lives alone, she is never truly lonely, for many visit her to get her cures and hear her poetry.\n\n"

 socotra.0024.desc.winner_6:0 "She is a portly mother of many children, who spends most of her time managing her household. Bold and assertive, they say even when she scolds and nags her many children, there is a poetic quality to it.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_7:0 "He is a merchant, who is prosperous and well off. With a honeyed tongue, a cunning mind, and good grasp of human nature, no wonder he is so successful in business and poetry!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_8:0 "She is the daughter of a nobleman. Yet this is no sheltered, spoiled lady. Her voice is lofty and pleasing to the ear, carrying with it whispers of the world - she clearly sees much and thinks about our place in the cosmos.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_9:0 "He is a former slave, who escaped here years ago, and gets by doing odd jobs. Yet the diversity of his experiences has come in handy, reflecting in his poetry, and he is good at mimicking the styles of many others.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_10:0 "She is a local prostitute, possessing a sweet dulcet voice, eloquent as she is notorious. They say men flock to her like bees to honey, but even jealous housewives admit they find her poetry seductive.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_11:0 "He is a scholar, one of the few from a local village who can read and write. Yet he does not let his knowledge of letters affect his recitations of poetry - on the contrary, it enhances his skill in upholding this oral tradition.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_12:0 "She is an older noble lady, regal of bearing, who dwells in a nearby mansion. Though widowed, it is clear she spends much of her time perfecting her poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_13:0 "He is a local ne’er-do-well, a rogue of low morals, so some who knew him were surprised he even won. Yet others are not surprised. After all, a successful rogue must know how to convince and persuade others in order to survive, and poetry is simply a higher form of that.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_14:0 "She is a maid in a prosperous household. Her master and mistress were kind enough to encourage natural poetic talent, and it has definitely paid off.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_15:0 "He is a middle aged noble. He can be a little arrogant, but at least when it comes to his poetry, his arrogance is well deserved. His voice carries authority, as if he could claim something ludicrous and everyone would believe it.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_16:0 "She is an elderly lady, one of the oldest in the land, who has many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Such an aged person has much wisdom and experience they can put into words and song.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_17:0 "He is a holy man, who spends most of his days reading scriptures, reciting prayers, and contemplating the divine in the name of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. But surely this only gives his poetry a more ethereal quality.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_18:0 "She is a beggar, the lowest of the low. Though here we know that poetry comes from many sources, we are surprised that such a person is so capable. How did we miss her for so long?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_19:0 "He is one of my lesser officials, a humble clerk. But it seems this clerk has dreamed of greater things than merely the paperwork at his desk. His voice is heavenly, surely something more than what one would expect for someone of his station!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_20:0 "She is the former concubine of a notorious pirate, cast aside when he lost interest in her. But she has not lost any of her beauty - neither the beauty of her face nor the beauty of her words and voice.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_21:0 "He is a local town guard. Many thought he was a mere brute, more brawn than brain. Clearly not! Good poetry can come from anyone, one just has to merely wait and find out from who. Despite the simplicity of his poetry, none can deny the eloquence in its brevity!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_22:0 "She is a young maiden, old enough to look for a husband, yet undecided on who to choose. Many say she already has many suitors, each wishing that he could hear her poetry forever, but she wants an intelligent, articulate husband who can compete with her when it comes to poetry. Who knows if she shall ever find such a man?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_23:0 "He is a fisherman who goes out to sea often to make ends meet. Every time he is out there, he must be singing these beautiful poems, luring the fish into his nets with his soothing voice.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_24:0 "She is a wife of one of my soldiers, tough and a little rough around the edges, but this only adds a certain blunt charm to her words. Her eyes are like fire, her words fiery.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_25:0 "He is one of the men who works to collect and sell frankincense. His work is hard and he often toils under the sun, but this seems to inspire him more. He often sings and practices his poetry while he is out in the field.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_26:0 "She is a wild woman, some say, someone who lost her mind years ago. Others claim she is a wise seer. Whoever she is, none can deny her mastery of poetry. Perhaps it is divinely inspired?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_27:0 "He is a local date farmer. They say his father was a foreign sailor or trader who seduced his mother before running away, explaining his odd appearance. He doesn't talk much about his origins, but one can pick up hints of his feelings in his poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_28:0 "She is the daughter of a pretty slave girl whose master bedded often as his concubine, yet he did not acknowledge the child - this woman - as his. For whatever reason, when he died, he freed mother and daughter in his will and the girl is now a simple maidservant. It is clear her humble origins have influenced her poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_29:0 "He is a young commoner who will soon get married. He and his bride-to-be, who have been friends since they were children, are deeply in love. He smiles at her as he recites his poem. Who knows what hidden meanings he has left in the poem, little secrets and jests that only she will understand?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_30:0 "She is but a mere adolescent, to everyone’s surprise. Yet her voice is firm, and her words wise and moving. There are adults who are twice, nay, three or four times her age, who only possess a fraction of her skill in speech. Truly, despite (or because of) her youth, this young girl has a promising future as a poet!\n\n"

People admire her fake beauty, so she goes through great lengths to hide her true, ugly face without cosmetics. A prince discovers what she really looks like, yet he still falls in love with her because of her kind, pure heart, so he agrees to keep her secret. The two lovers go through many trials as the girl learns to love herself for her inner and outer beauty, before they marry.

 socotra.0024.desc.poem_6:0 "The poem is about the poet’s family history, and about one great deed of an ancestor from long ago. Whether true or not, whether this ancestor is even real, the story is entertaining!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_7:0 "The poem is a biting satire that makes fun of everyone and anyone. None can escape the poet’s criticisms, some well-deserved."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_8:0 "The poem is an ode to the beauty of our land, but also an ode to the good people who dwell there. People are ultimately good and can do good things, the poet argues in the veiled language. An idealistic poem if there was ever one!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_9:0 "The poem is a tragedy about the downfall of a person because of their hubris and their moral failings. Such stories, whether told in poetic form or not, are always a fable that all of us should heed!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_10:0 "The poem is about a merchant or sailor who travels to faraway land so that he may find riches and profit. The poet seems to poke fun at people's greed, too, when they portray this merchant or sailor as insatiably ravenous in his pursuit of wealth and glory."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_11:0 "The poem is about an adventurer who travels to another land and finds himself trapped with all sorts of dangers but escapes through his wits - no matter if he faces bloodthirsty man-eating monsters, wild tribes of Amazons, cruel and vindictive Sultans, or everyday scoundrels, he always comes out on top. That does not mean that the poem isn’t a nail-biter, though."

 socotra.0024.desc.poem_15:0 "The poem is a historical tale that recalls one of the earlier events of the land's history, and all the politics, intrigue, and warring involved. Some details may have been changed or made up as poetic license."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_16:0 "The poem is a polite and formal, yet biting and unrestrained critique of another well-known villager in the poet’s hometown. Clearly the two had some disagreements in the past, and the poet shows no qualms about making this rivalry public."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_17:0 "The poem is advice to a friend who recently got themselves in a quandary. Though the poet slyly used metaphors and symbols to mask the true events and people involved, strangely, everyone feels as if they learned something even if we won't ever know the full details."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_18:0 "The poem seems irreverent at first, speaking of mundane things, but eventually it becomes clear that it is actually a friendly yet very subtle teasing towards the poet’s friend, who happens to be the poet who got second place. The two of them exchange knowing looks - it is clear that for some of the metaphors, only they will ever understand."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_19:0 "The poem is simultaneously hilarious yet unsettlingly odd, in a way no one feels they can truly understand. It is about a brother and a sister who challenge each other to a game of cleaning each other's teeth. What is the deeper meaning here?"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_20:0 "The poem is about a girl who has no choice but to ask a conman who once deceived her to save her beloved from a wrathful djinn. The conman reluctantly agrees, for despite his profession and his jaded outlook on life, he is a moral man deep down. How ironic that a villain is turned into a hero!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_21:0 "The poem is about a beautiful peasant girl from a local village, who is courted by a wealthy stranger - perhaps a Prince of some foreign land, or a merchant who possesses many riches. He offers her many gifts, each more luxurious than the last, yet she refuses to become his concubine and maintains her honor to her name and her tribe. In the end, she marries a handsome, local boy she had known since they were children."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_22:0 "The poem is a comical one about an idiot and a misadventure he gets into. Yet, despite his stupidity, his good nature ensures that no misfortune can ever dissuade him from a positive mindset."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_23:0 "The poem is a reenactment of a legal dispute between two neighbors. The poet skillfully weaves a story where the audience does not know which side to support - both parties have their good points, and reasons why they are in the right. Vivid metaphors are used to symbolize the intensity of their arguments."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_24:0 "The poem is told from the perspective of a young maiden, who explains what she is looking for in a suitor. She has high expectations, almost comically so. Will she ever find someone she deems worthy of being her husband? The poet intentionally ends the poem on a cliffhanger."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_25:0 "The poem is a retelling of a poem improvised by a famous but very arrogant poet from centuries ago. In the old poem, which everyone knows, the poet praised the impenetrable defenses of his town's fortifications. The irony comes from the fact that the town was razed to the ground by enemies many years later. The current poet is twisting the original metaphors and symbols which were smug shows of superiority into a warning about the dangers of hubris. Quite clever!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_26:0 "The poem is an apology to someone the poet wronged not too long ago, eloquent in its use of symbols to convey the poet’s deep regret and hope for reconciliation. The person they are apologizing to happens to be in the crowd, and acknowledges the apology with a curt nod."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_27:0 "The poem praises the beauty of someone, albeit it is hard to tell who exactly given the many layers of veiled language involved. So many metaphors! Perhaps it is just a discussion of beauty in the abstract, or perhaps it is praise to someone the poet admires but is too shy to talk to."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_28:0 "The poem is a rather intellectual discussion on the society we live in. It explores our customs, ideas, and beliefs, and what might be good and what might be evil. Everyone who hears the poem will surely contemplate these profound matters for days to come."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_29:0 "The poem is about two people who care about each other very much - perhaps two lovers, or a parent and child, or good friends - who are separated due to circumstance. The poet expresses the feelings of sorrow about the separation these two have, and hope that they will someday be reunited."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_30:0 "The poem is told from the point of view of a bird that flies from one land to another across the great blue seas. The poet expertly describes what the vast expanse of land and ocean the bird sees from its vantage point, and everyone challenges themselves to understand the deeper meaning of the metaphors the poet uses."

However, recently these herders have made some errors in judgment. In a number of places on the island, the soil is no longer good for its native fauna such as the famed Dragon's Blood, resulting in loss of profit for merchants dealing in these rare, exotic commodities.

The temple of Arkona on the island of Rugen (in modern-day Germany) was a major religious site for Slavic pagans in the early medieval period.

After the capture of Arkona by the Danish troops under King Valdemar I and Bishop Absalon of Denmark in 1168 CE, the idol was torn down, and the island gradually Christianized."

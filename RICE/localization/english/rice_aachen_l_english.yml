 aachen.0001.desc:0 "Charlemagne is a name that echoes across the history of Europe. After the fall of the Western Roman Emperor, there have been few rulers, if any, who matched him in deeds and splendor. A great monarch like him deserves to be portrayed by fittingly majestic artwork.\n\nI have commissioned a beautiful bust of Charlemagne, unlike any other, which will be the centerpiece of the Aachen Cathedral Treasury. Made by goldsmiths from the Meuse valley, they have successfully depicted a fully bearded Charlemagne in all his glory.\n\nWord has spread far and wide of the bust, and it will surely attract even more pilgrims to Aachen, who wish to see all of the holy and secular treasures kept at the city’s Cathedral."
 aachen.0001.a:0 "If only I could have met Charlemagne himself!"
 aachen.0002.t:0 "The Bust of Charlemagne"
 aachen.0002.desc:0 "We’ve received word that [aachen_charlemagne_buster.GetTitledFirstName] has just commissioned a most beautiful golden bust of the great and mighty Charlemagne. Those who have seen it say is a striking work of art, and one which is perfect for such a peerless, influential ruler. Certainly, many within Christendom believe he deserves such an honor.\n\nWord has spread far and wide of the bust, which is now housed in the treasury of Aachen Cathedral. It will surely attract even more pilgrims to Aachen, who wish to see all of the holy and secular treasures kept at the city’s Cathedral."
 aachen.0002.a:0 "Interesting. It must have cost a lot to make."
 aachen.0003.t:0 "Charlemagne's Reburial"
 aachen.0003.desc:0 "Since his passing, Charlemagne had been entombed in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen Cathedral. A great man like him deserves to lie in something more glorious than just a mere chapel. As such, I have ordered that he be reburied in the main part of the Cathedral. In a lavish ceremony, he was reburied there in a majestic sarcophagus.\n\nFor many years, locals in the region have regarded him as a saint, though the Church has not officially canonized him, and has indicated it has no intention to. Now that he has a truly  splendid resting place, it will surely attract more pilgrims to Aachen to pay their respects to him, whether they believe he is truly a saint or not."
 aachen.0003.a:0 "Charlemagne shall be remembered forever!"
 aachen.0004.t:0 "Charlemagne's Reburial"
 aachen.0004.desc:0 "Since his passing, Charlemagne had been entombed in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen Cathedral. Some felt this was too humble an arrangement for such a famous and accomplished figure. [aachen_charlemagne_mover.GetTitledFirstName] has thus just ordered for Charlemagne to be reburied in the main part of Aachen Cathedral. In a lavish ceremony, he was reburied there in a majestic sarcophagus.\n\nFor many years, locals had regarded Charlemagne as a saint, though the Church has not officially canonized him, and has indicated it has no intention to. Still, because he now has a truly splendid resting place, it will surely attract more pilgrims to Aachen to pay their respects to him, whether they believe he is truly a saint or not."

 aachen.0005.desc:0 "The Romans lived in Maastricht many centuries ago, and the bridge they built there that crossed the Meuse had been used reliably since then. Unfortunately, all things must pass. Recently, a large procession of people were traversing the bridge; unable to bear the burden of such a sizable crowd, the bridge collapsed, killing hundreds.\n\nBeyond the initial tragedy, further problems lie ahead. The bridge had been an important crossing point along the Meuse river for so long, that its sudden disappearance would be devastating to the local economy. A number of local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are appealing to powerful notables in the area like me to sponsor the construction of a new bridge."
 aachen.0005.a:0 "I will have to think this over."
 aachen.0006.t:0 "Bridge Collapse in Maastricht"
 aachen.0006.desc:0 "I’ve received news that the old Roman bridge in Maastricht recently collapsed when a large procession of people attempted to cross it. As this bridge had been a critical crossing point over the Meuse, a major river in the area, its sudden loss will likely have negative effects on the region for quite some time. Talk is already under way by various notables in Maastricht, including its ruler, [meuse_bridge_collapser.GetTitledFirstName], on if a replacement bridge is possible, and where it could be built."
 aachen.0006.a:0 "It is an unfortunate tragedy."
 aachen.0007.t:0 "New Bridge in Maastricht"
 aachen.0007.desc:0 "When the old Roman bridge collapsed in Maastricht, we were all shocked and dismayed. Not only was the loss of hundreds of lives tragic, it also had negative effects on the region’s economy. Thankfully, we can put those days behind us. At the urging of local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], I and a number of important local figures pooled together our resources to sponsor the construction of a large stone bridge downstream from the old one. It is a marvel of engineering, being one of the first stone bridges in the region, and it will serve Maastricht well for years to come. In fact, some believe trade in the region will be even better with this new and improved bridge!"

 aachen.0008.t:0 "New Bridge in Maastricht"
 aachen.0008.desc:0 "Not too long ago, the old Roman bridge in Maastricht collapsed, with considerable loss of life. It also affected the region’s economy negatively. However, thanks to the efforts of Maastricht’s ruler, [meuse_bridge_builder.GetTitledFirstName], and several other important figures in the region, a new bridge has been constructed some distance downstream. It is one of the few stone bridges in the region, and it will surely help facilitate the growth of commerce there."
 aachen.0008.a:0 "That’s good to hear."
 aachen.0009.t:0 "Shrine of Grannus"
 aachen.0009.desc:0 "A shrine to Grannus stands near the thermal springs by Aachen, now that those who worship the old gods like me are active in the region once more.

This Grannus was the patron god of hot springs, particularly the ones found near Aachen.\n\nNow that there is a growing community of pagans in the area, including myself, I have decided it is a good time to honor Grannus again, by dedicating a shrine to him. This humble but stately shrine will be situated in the forests near the famed hot springs, and be a source of spiritual comfort for any who visits this area. It is my hope that Grannus appreciates this gesture, given it must have been so long since anyone deemed him worthy of worship."

 aachen.0020.t:0 "Preparations"
 aachen.0020.desc:0 "One of the most noted pilgrimage sites for Christians like myself is Aachen, as it was once the capital of Charlemagne. At any rate, I’ve decided to undertake this pilgrimage to Aachen. In particular, I hope to visit Aachen Cathedral and examine its unrivaled and extensive treasury, which houses a number of famed and inspiring religious and secular objects."
 aachen.0020.a:0 "I need to prepare for the trip."
 aachen.0021.t:0 "To Aachen!"
 aachen.0021.desc:0 "The time has come! I have finished with all of my preparations, and will now be starting my holy pilgrimage to Aachen. Charlemagne’s Capital awaits me!"
 aachen.0021.a:0 "I wonder what I will see there."
 aachen.0022.t:0 "Charlemagne's Capital"
 aachen.0022.desc:0 "I have arrived in the center of Aachen, the great city of the Frankish ruler Charlemagne. Pilgrims bustle about, no doubt here to visit Aachen Cathedral and the city’s other sights, just like me. I and my entourage decide to find appropriate lodgings for ourselves. Later, we will visit Aachen Cathedral, and hopefully see the spiritual wonders stored within."
 aachen.0022.a:0 "I’m glad to be here."
 aachen.0023.t:0 "Inside the Cathedral"
 aachen.0023.desc:0 "In the past few days, while at Aachen, I visited some other religious sites and met with some of the town’s notables. Today, with all my other business taken care of, I can finally enter Aachen Cathedral itself at last. It is a remarkable and splendid building, designed by a talented architect by the name of Odo of Metz. I sit in the main part of the Cathedral, reflecting on my faith, and engaging in prayer."
 aachen.0023.desc.charlemagne_reburied:0 "\n\nWhile in the main part of the Cathedral, I also decide to pay my respects to the great Charlemagne himself. Some time ago, his remains were exhumed and reburied here in a majestic sarcophagus, and placed in the so-called Karlsschrein, or Shrine of Charlemagne. It is amazing to think that now, I am so close to such an influential and august figure!"
 aachen.0023.a:0 "A marvelous place."
 aachen.0024.t:0 "Aachen Cathedral Treasury"
 aachen.0024.desc.start:0 "After spending some time in the main part of the Cathedral, I go to view the Cathedral’s unique treasury, which contains many relics and objects, both religious and secular. One item strikes my fancy, a truly astounding work of art which I find spiritually inspiring."
 aachen.0024.desc.lothair:0 "\n\nThe #V Cross of Lothair#! is often used in holy processions in Aachen. It is called such due to the engraved, green crystal seal near its base, which bears the name of a great-grandson of Charlemagne, King Lothair II. Its oak core, encased in gold and silver, is decorated with many jewels. Where the arms of the cross meet, there is an onyx carving of Augustus Caesar, dating back to Roman times. Below this is a seal bearing the inscription: “O Christ, help King Lothair!”"
 aachen.0024.desc.sabre:0 "\n\nThe sword most famously associated with Charlemagne is Joyeuse, but the sword in front of me, called the #V Sabre of Charlemagne#!, is no less imposing! Crafted in a style reminiscent of the swords used by the nomad warriors of the Pontic Steppe, it was said to have been found when Charlemagne’s grave was opened one time. Who knows what battles this sword fought in?"
 aachen.0024.desc.purse:0 "\n\nBefore my eyes is #V Saint Stephen’s Purse#!, a rectangular gold reliquary, studded with many, many gemstones. The purse contains soil said to be soaked with the blood of Saint Stephen, when he was martyred and killed in the Holy Land in ancient times. His martyrdom was witnessed by Saul of Tarsus, who would later become the Apostle Paul."
 aachen.0024.desc.situla:0 "\n\nThere, before me, is the so-called #V Ivory Situla#!. While there are plenty of these kinds of vessels for Holy water around Christendom, it is still remarkable to see the one that belongs here, in this Cathedral, where many great men and women once passed. It is masterfully crafted, and a worthy vessel for holding Holy water."
 aachen.0024.desc.a_gospel:0 "\n\nThe #V Aachen Gospel#!, as some know it, call to me. I tenderly examine the illuminated manuscript with my fingers, and the texts and images within it. For example, there is a page of the manuscript that beautifully depicts the Four Evangelists - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - sitting on a hilly landscape. The last few pages of the manuscript contain the Capitulare Evangeliorum, a list of gospel verses read at Sunday services and high feasts."
 aachen.0024.desc.olifant:0 "\n\nI see before my eyes two objects: #V the olifant (or hunting horn) and the hunting knife of Charlemagne#!. I have seen a few olifants - or hunting horns made from ivory - here and there, but none like this one. The geometric designs that decorate it are striking. Meanwhile, the hunting knife is simple in design, yet still looks regal given all the history it must have had. What adventures did Charlemagne have with his paladins, like Roland and Oliver, with this olifant and hunting knife?"
 aachen.0024.desc.c_gospel:0 "\n\nMy eyes are drawn to the #V Coronation Gospel#!, an illuminated manuscript produced at the court of Charlemagne, which he used at his coronation ceremony on Christmas Day in the year 800. It is said he placed three of his fingers of his right hand on the first page of the Gospel of Saint John when he took his oath. As my fingers touch that same page, I imagine what it would have been like to witness that coronation - a watershed moment in the history of the world."
 aachen.0024.desc.bust:0 "\n\nI am amazed by the #V Bust of Charlemagne#!, which gazes at me with a regal pose, undaunted by anything. This brilliant, golden bust was crafted by the famed goldsmiths of the Meuse river valley, and is a testament to their skill and creativity. The top part contains a fragment of Charlemagne’s skull, while the head of the bust is adorned with a spectacular crown."
 aachen.0024.a:0 "Magnificent. Truly magnificent."
 aachen.0025.t:0 "Time to Go Home"
 aachen.0025.desc:0 "My stay in Aachen comes to a close, and it is time for me to make the journey back home. Visiting the holy sights in this old and respected city is an amazing experience, and I leave feeling inspired by the things I’ve seen."
 aachen.0025.a:0 "Let us make preparations to leave."
 aachen.0026.t:0 "Home At Last"
 aachen.0026.desc:0 "I have returned home from my pilgrimage to Aachen. I had a wonderful and profound experience, all things said, as I engrossed myself in the grandeur and majesty of Charlemagne’s capital, as well as the spiritual inspiration it provided. Surely, this will help me with my devotion to my Christian beliefs for years to come."

 aachen.0030.a:0 "His mighty conquests of his enemies!"

 aachen.0031.desc:0 "Though Charlemagne has never been recognized as a Saint by any Christian sect, quite a number of Christians in Aachen have seen him as one over the years. For the most part, local authorities tend to look the other way when it comes to these beliefs, but lately, one firebrand priest is starting to preach a lot about this “Saint Charlemagne” and causing quite a stir…."
 aachen.0031.a:0 "Lock him up - what if he turns the masses on us?"
 aachen.0031.b:0 "Troublemaker or not, this isn't a serious threat to us."

 aachen.0033.t:0 "Souvenir Badges from Aachen"
 aachen.0033.desc:0 "Ever since Aachen became a popular pilgrimage site for Christians generations ago, a tradition of badge making developed. These pewter badges were usually meant to be souvenirs for pilgrims to take home, and vary greatly in size. Even as I pass through the streets of Aachen daily, I see many pilgrims carrying these badges with them."
 aachen.0033.a:0 "Just an easy way to make money off gullible fools."
 aachen.0033.b:0 "These people are surely a faithful, spiritual lot!"
 aachen.0033.c:0 "Why show off? Isn't the pilgrimage more important?"

 aachen.0034.t:0 "Swimming Near Aachen"
 aachen.0034.desc:0 "Today I took some time off to visit one of the smaller lakes near Aachen, and swim around and enjoy myself. While there, I reflect on how back in his day, Charlemagne was known for being an avid swimmer. As Aachen was his main residence and capital, I have to wonder if he once swam in this lake as well."
 aachen.0034.a:0 "I wonder how good of a swimmer he was?"
 aachen.0035.t:0 "Charlemagne: Saint or Not?"
 aachen.0035.desc:0 "While walking through the streets of Aachen, I overhear two commoners arguing about Charlemagne. One, specifically, is claiming others have done in Aachen for many years, that Charlemagne is indeed a Saint who is responsible for several miracles and is the protector of the city. The other commoner scoffs at this and says the Christian church has never canonized Charlemagne, and a great and noble man is not necessarily a Saint, so how can he be a Saint?"
 aachen.0035.a:0 "Given his deeds, Charlemagne being a Saint is a reasonable theory."
 aachen.0035.b:0 "If the Christian Church didn't recognize him, then he isn't a Saint."

However, instead of actually relaxing like [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] wanted to, [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] somehow got into an argument with one of the other spa-goers there! It was about something trivial, as far as I can see, but the incident has put [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetHerHim] in a bad mood and [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] has been complaining about it all day."
 aachen.0036.a:0 "Sorry to hear that - that other person sounds terrible!"

At any rate, this recent situation has bolstered the existing and celebrated community of brassworkers in Maastricht."

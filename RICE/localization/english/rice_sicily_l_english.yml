 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_ender_name: "[GetGeographicalRegion('custom_sicily').GetNameNoTooltip], the Dominion"
 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_ender_desc: "[GetGeographicalRegion('custom_sicily').GetNameNoTooltip] is a land that is paradoxically at the center of the Mediterranean, yet has also been a frontier to the great civilizations dwelling in this great sea. It was never the master of its own fate, until [struggle_ender.GetFirstName] finally tamed this wild frontier and brought order to it under one great dominion."
 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_legend_chapter_opening_struggle: "For centuries, the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'struggle' ).GetFlagName] was a region that many fought over, but none could master. It was where three worlds – the Latin West, Byzantium, and Islam – competed in various ways, some peaceful and some less so, resulting in constant conflict and depredation. This sorry state of affairs came to an end with the coming of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], who united this ancient land under one dominion: [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHersHis]." 
 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_legend_chapter_motivation_struggle: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] saw the anarchy at the heart of this frontier, and how it prevented this land and its people from developing. If [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_sicily').GetNameNoTooltip] was to prosper, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] reasoned, it needed a strong leader to unite under."
 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_legend_chapter_famous_deed_generic: "Unity, however, was easier said than done. [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_sicily').GetNameNoTooltip] was the result of many influences across the Mediterranean, and its many people, from invading newcomers to more ancient inhabitants, were constantly locked in various squabbles. To unite the land, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had to put an end to the constant chaos that defined southern Italy and become the greatest ruler the land had ever seen."
 RICE_sicily_struggle_dominion_legend_chapter_extra_deed_struggle: "Through military and political means, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] brought the petty warlords of [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_sicily').GetNameNoTooltip] under [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] heel. To those who were cooperative, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] sent envoys who strong-armed and sweet-talked others into becoming [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] vassals and subjects. To others who were violent, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] sent terryfing armies and navies to squash any opposition."

Though it had been in decline for years, the collapse of the Kalbid Emirate in 1040 CE heralded the start of a new era of civil war and fragmentation in Muslim Sicily. Unlike Iberia, where some local #italic taifas#! were able to transform into powerful, prosperous regional centers, the #italic taifas#! of Sicily were relatively weak and unable to consolidate their power, and had to seek foreign aid against their rivals. For instance, the Zirid dynasty of North Africa continuously intervened in the island's politics for decades.\n\nWith that context, the fact that Ibn al-Thumna, the ruler of Syracuse, requested for Norman military aid in 1061 CE is not so abnormal. Nonetheless, al-Thumna's death in 1062 provided the Normans under Roger a convenient excuse to conquer the whole island. Interestingly, al-Thumna's followers continued fighting alongside Roger as allies, and some local Christians were among those who resisted the Normans.\n\nA later ruler of Syracuse, Ibn Abbad, known in Christian sources as Benavert, led the last resistance to the Normans. After his death in 1086 in battle, the Norman conquest of Sicily concluded with the fall of Noto in 1091."

It took years, for instance, for Sawdan to be acknowledged as governor by the Abbasid government – a title that in fact had previously been requested by his predecessor, Mufarrag.\n\nRegardless, Sawdan's depiction in primary sources is conflicting. Christian sources portray him as a ruthless tyrant and treacherous snake, while Muslim and Jewish sources depict him as a learned, just, productive ruler, who had in a friend the Jewish scholar Abu Aaron.\n\nAfter Bari fell in 871, Sawdan's eventual fate is uncertain.

For instance, the 14th century Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio (best known for his famous Decameron), made use of Baia as a setting in one of his novels, #italic The Elegy of Lady Fiammetta#!. The protagonist goes to Baia to relax and forget about her adulterous love affair, but realizes it is counterproductive because “even the most chaste women forget their feminine modesty and seem to take more liberties on all occasions” in Baia.\n\nRegardless, medieval people were very much aware of Baia’s reputation, good and bad, amongst the ancients, and some medieval sources about Baia make reference to ancient sources like that of Virgil."

 sicily.0213.desc:0 "On the island of [GetTitleByKey('c_malta').GetNameNoTier], there is a special fungus, said to have many miraculous medicinal properties – the denizens of the Middle East even call it the “treasure of drugs.” Though it is said to grow in several places around the world, in Europe and the Mediterranean, it only grows in large, harvestable amounts on a small islet off the coast of [GetTitleByKey('c_malta').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nToday, some travelers visiting my court wish to gift me this so-called Maltese fungus. It has a variety of wonderful uses, from treating wounds, to acting as a contraceptive, to aiding with recovery from dysentery and vomiting."
 sicily.0213.a:0 "A most pleasant gift!"
 sicily.0213.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! #italic Cynomorium#! is a genus of flowering plants erroneously referred to as Maltese fungus or Maltese mushroom. Historically, it was said to have many medicinal uses, in particular the treatment of wounds. In the early modern period, due to the plant’s rarity in Europe and the Mediterranean, the Knights Hospitallier who came to rule Malta in the late medieval period guarded its production and export carefully."

 sicily.0214.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('c_malta').GetNameNoTier] is a major exporter of “tongue stones,” strange stones in the shape of snakes’ tongues. Many believe that these stones have useful medicinal qualities, and in particular are useful as a safeguard against poison.\n\nRecently, prominent merchants in [county.GetNameNoTier] have been able to secure favorable trade deals with locals who gather these tongue stones. I might even want to invest in this trade, given the usefulness of such a product."
 sicily.0214.a:0 "The traders of [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] are a resourceful lot!"
 sicily.0214.info:0 "Medieval Malta was a major supplier of fossilized sharks’ teeth, which at the time were known as “tongue stones” or “snake tongues.” During the medieval period, tongue stones were, among other medical uses, a common cure or protection against poison. There was a tradition at the time of hanging tongue stones from decorative trees on tables during feasts; guests could dip the tongue stones into their wine or drink, assured that they would not be poisoned."

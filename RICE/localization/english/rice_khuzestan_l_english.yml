Early medieval Islamic sources mention the existence of a so-called Khuzi people, who spoke a language that modern scholars theorize to be a late remnant of ancient Elamite. Although Khuzi was spoken by local nobility, this may have been because they learned it from their servants (such as wet-nurses, bathroom attendants, and so on). The Khuzis were otherwise treated as low status; for example, #italic "yā Xuz̄ı!"#!, meaning "Hey, you Khuzi!" was reported by the 10th century Arab geographer Al-Maqdisi as a common, slang term of insult in the region. Because of this, the Khuzi identity and language likely faded away as the Khuzis assimilated into Arab or Iranian populations."

They say with the right funding, we can hire engineers and laborers to renovate this canal and make it useful again. This, in turn, would increase the amount of arable land considerably."
 khuzestan.0050.a:0 "Very well! They will have the funds they need."
 khuzestan.0050.b:0 "I think our resources are best spent elsewhere."
 khuzestan.0051.t:0 "Land of the Sugar Cane"
 khuzestan.0051.desc:0 "Sugar from Khuzestan is well-known throughout the Middle East for its quality, and massive amounts of this sugar are exported to other regions. Indeed, that is why some call Khuzestan the “Land of the Sugar Cane.”\n\nAs luck would have it, my cooks recently acquired a large shipment of some of the finest sugar from Khuzestan. They are certain that this sugar will serve us well in the near future, whether they use it to make sweets and pastries I can enjoy as a snack, or for delicious dishes at any feasts I might host!"
 khuzestan.0051.a:0 "I look forward to eating the sugary delights my cooks make!"

 khuzestan.0052.desc:0 "[GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_khuzestan_region').GetName] has been renowned for its weaving for centuries. Clothes, robes, rugs, quilts, and more from this region are sold in markets around the world.\n\nRecently, the weavers of [county.GetNameNoTier] have gained much fame, as their products are considered some of the region’s finest."
 khuzestan.0052.a:0 "That’s excellent for the local economy!"
 khuzestan.0053.t:0 "Learning from the Ancients"
 khuzestan.0053.desc:0 "I’ve recently traveled to my territories in [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_khuzestan_region').GetName] to better understand the local issues there. One thing I noted were the great engineering structures, many built long ago by the ancient Persians, that seemed to dot the landscape as it were.\n\nEver since I’ve returned home, these brilliant construction feats have been on my mind. To think that the ancients were capable of such wonders!\n\nIt has occurred to me that perhaps I should send some engineers and scholars to study these structures. That way, we can apply the engineering methods the ancients used to help us in various building projects we have around the realm."
 khuzestan.0053.a:0 "A good idea! Let’s do that."
 khuzestan.0053.b:0 "I should focus on other issues."

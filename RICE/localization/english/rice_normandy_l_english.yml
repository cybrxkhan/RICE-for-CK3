In medieval times, Mont-Saint-Michel was a popular pilgrimage destination associated with the Archangel Michael. At first, veneration of Michael was often done indirectly through Saint Aubert, the Abbey's legendary 8th century founder. Aubert was even more popular than Michael and had an annual procession in nearby Avranches that was said to cause many miracles. Later on, pilgrims' focus shifted to Michael and the Virgin Mary rather than Aubert; for example, King Philip IV of France donated a large golden statue to the Abbey to render Michael more visible to all. The Reformation, and later the French Revolution, led to a decline in the pilgrimage's popularity."

Nonetheless, according to Dudo's #italic Historia Normannorum#!, when Rollo first arrived in Normandy, Haesteinn, as the villainous foil to Rollo, attempted to coerce Rollo into becoming the French king's vassal. Rollo, having gone into exile thanks to the cruelties of another king, declined, and he fought many battles with the Franks. Eventually, the two sides made peace in 911 CE, with Rollo being baptized after he was granted Normandy as a fief.\n\nDudo then inserts an amusing anecdote, as if to soften the implication that Rollo was now submissive to the French king. When he was granted Normandy, the French demanded he kiss the king's foot as thanks for the grant of land. After much urging, Rollo finally asked one of his warriors do it in his stead. The warrior proceeded to grab the king's foot, raised it to his mouth, and kissed it, while he was still standing and the king had landed flat on his back."

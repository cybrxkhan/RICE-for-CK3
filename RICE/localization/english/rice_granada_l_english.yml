Oddly, this story does not appear in historical sources until centuries after the massacre. Thus, even if he did write the poem, it is unlikely it was the true cause of the pogrom, as anti-Semitism had likely been rising for years in Granada.\n\nEither way, the massacre began on December 30 when a rumor spread that Joseph had killed Granada's king, Badis, to betray the kingdom to their rival, Almeria. A mob gathered to storm the palace where Joseph sought refuge. Even after he brought Badis forth to show the king was alive, the mob murdered and crucified him, before descending on the city's Jewish quarters.\n\nThe surviving Jews fled elsewhere, and though some would return in the coming decades (before being expelled by the Almoravids in 1090), Granada's Jewish community would never regain its former glory."

However, with more recent changes in Iberia’s geopolitical situation and global trade routes, [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] is no longer able to produce the vast amounts of silk it once did.\n\nWhile other rulers on the peninsula scramble to finance the growth of silk workshops elsewhere, I am blessed to rule [almeria.GetNameNoTier]. Many merchants I am acquainted with have told me that it is the perfect settlement to take over the role [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] had as the center of Iberia’s silk industry - some even say that it may surpass [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] one day, but I am not sure whether I’ll see that in my lifetime.\n\nEither way, [almeria.GetNameNoTier] is one of the most important ports in the Western Mediterranean, and so, it can export large amounts of silks to other lands. This, no doubt, will ensure the city's future prosperity."

[cordoba.GetNameNoTier] soon became a major hub of silk production, due to royal patronage by the Umayyads.\n\nNow, however, due to years of conflict in Iberia, and changes in global trade, [cordoba.GetNameNoTier] has declined as a leading producer of silk. Silk workshops have sprung up in many Iberian cities, but [almeria.GetNameNoTier] stands above them all, as it has clearly inherited the mantle of Iberia’s center of silk production from [cordoba.GetNameNoTier].\n\nThe elites in [almeria.GetNameNoTier], particularly [silk_investor.GetTitledFirstName], have realized the potential profit of the silk trade, and have begun to heavily invest in the city’s silk industry. As one of the largest seaports in the Western Mediterranean, the city is well-suited to export so-called Almerian Silk, which is starting to gain renown throughout Europe and the Middle East for its quality."

 granada.0090.desc:0 "Today, I’m inspecting some of the canals in [granada_county.GetNameNoTier]. Many of them carry water from the Darro river into the city’s various districts, but there are also some coming from other nearby rivers like the Genil.\n\nEither way, it’s good that I am kept up to date with how these canals are doing. Not only are they essential to providing water for the locals to use, whether for drinking, bathing, farming, industrial work, and more, but it is important that I know where the canals are, whether any need maintenance work or further improvements, and which of them we can rely on in the event of a siege by our enemies or if natural calamities happen."

Many people visit these wells, springs, or small pools of water scattered about the land for religious reasons. I am no different, as I have decided to visit a holy well of some local renown in [county.GetNameNoTier].\n\nOnce I arrive at the site, though it is relatively small, it is serene and humbling. I feel a sense of spiritual and physical peace that I haven't felt in a while. I pray to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, and leave offerings before I depart."

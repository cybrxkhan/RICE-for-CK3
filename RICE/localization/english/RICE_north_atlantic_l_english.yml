 # Legends
 RICE_greenland_ender_name: "The Greenland Colony Succeeds"
 RICE_greenland_ender_desc: "Though it took years of hard work, the colony of Greenland is no longer struggle. It has emerged as a prosperous, integral part of the world of the North Atlantic, thanks to [struggle_ender.GetFirstName]."
 RICE_greenland_legend_chapter_opening_struggle: "Long after the first settlers arrived in Greenland, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetNameNoTooltip] would complete the process of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'struggle' ).GetFlagName] when [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] led the final efforts to establish these Greenland colonies as a self-sufficient and integral part of the North Atlantic." 
 RICE_greenland_legend_chapter_motivation_struggle: "Though Greenland had been connected to the rest of Eurasia for many years, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] knew that the colony was, despite whatever wealth it generated from walrus ivory, always in constant danger, with the threat of collapse looming evermore. Thus, if there was to be a new future for Greenland, and if the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'struggle' ).GetFlagName] was to be a success, the colony needed leadership: leadership which [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] provided."
 RICE_greenland_legend_chapter_famous_deed_generic: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip|U] legend is one of a heroic adventures, which involves both glorious battle, but also initiatives dedicated to dialogue and development – in other words, a concerted effort to build the Greenland colony beyond its original raison dêtre. If it was to survive, it had to become an economic, political, and cultural center of the North Atlantic."
 RICE_greenland_legend_chapter_extra_deed_struggle: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had to face enemies of two kinds. First, of course, there were those who sought to weaken if not destroy the colony and its native friends, both enemies in the lands of Greenland, as well as enemies back in Europe who were envious of the money it made from its luxurious products, like walrus ivory. Yet there were other enemies too. The harsh climate of the colony was an ever-present danger, as was the bickering of the colonists with their petty differences. Also dangerous, too, were the foolish ambitions of those who wished to sail to Vinland, rather than wisely build up the colony of Greenland."
 RICE_greenland_legend_chapter_conclusion_ended_struggle: "There were those who thought that the Greenland colony would fail, but [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] proved them wrong. Through [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] wisdom and guidance, the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'struggle' ).GetFlagName] concluded when Greenland established itself as an integral part of the North Atlantic, connecting both Old World and New World forevermore."
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_ender_name: "Sunset Invasion"
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_ender_desc: "While the indigenous peoples of Eurasia vainly attempted to succeed in colonizing Greenland, it took a true [struggle_ender.GetCulture.GetName] leader of great wisdom and courage to bring the world of the North Atlantic together: [struggle_ender.GetFirstName]."
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_legend_chapter_opening_struggle: "After the first settlers from Eurasia arrived to initiate the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'struggle' ).GetFlagName], there was increased contact between the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic. However, it took a visionary leader, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetNameNoTooltip], to do what these short-sighted colonists could not, and not only bring together the North Atlantic, but to also assert [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetNameNoTooltip] sovereignty over this vast ocean."  # not only explore and discover more about the tapestry of pepoles 
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_legend_chapter_motivation_struggle: "When the peoples native to the western Atlantic first encountered the peoples of Eurasia, sometimes their interactions were peaceful, with increased trade and diplomacy. Other times, these interactions were less than peaceful, with arrogant settlers from Greenland denigrating those like the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetNameNoTooltip] as uncivilized, so-called "skraelings." [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetNameNoTooltip] wished to prove the enemies of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] wrong, and to reinforce good ties with their allies."
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_legend_chapter_famous_deed_generic: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip|U] legend is one of a heroic adventures, which involves both glorious battle, but also initiatives dedicated to dialogue and development – in other words, a concerted effort to not only conquer and subdue the enemies of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip], but to build alliances and trade networks."
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_legend_chapter_extra_deed_struggle: "As [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] increased the power of the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] across the Atlantic, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] spoke of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHim] and the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] as a "Sunset Invasion." But [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] embraced such a label, for it brought fear into the hearts of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] enemies, and delight into that of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] friends."
 RICE_greenland_sunset_invasion_legend_chapter_conclusion_ended_struggle: "After many adventures, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] led the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetNameNoTooltip] people to completely dominate the North Atlantic, and control the strategic passageway of Greenland that binds together these two sides of the ocean. Even their enemies no longer call them "skraelings," and instead speak of them with equal parts respect and fear. There is little doubt that [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will be a leader remembered for generations."
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_name: "Settlement of Vinland"
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_desc: "Settling Vinland permanently was a dream for fools, for those who had no sense of the economical reality and the practical difficulty of doing such a thing. [settler.GetTitledFirstName] was one such fool. But unlike the other fools who tried settling Vinland permament, [settler.GetSheHe] did what they could not: [settler.GetSheHe] succeeded."
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_chapter_opening_new_title: "Vinland the Good. Vinland the Distant. Vinland the Legendary. Ever since the first explorers sailed westward across the Atlantic from cold Greenland, stories and whispers abounded of a mythical land, where grew self-sown wheat and the sweetest of grapes. Nonetheless, dreams of settling this land did not come to fruition for many years, for the peoples of Eurasia wisely chose to invest in Greenland, an important sort of walrus ivory, instead." 
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], like some of the adventurers and travelers in the North Atlantic, dreamed of the wonders and legends of the far west. Against common wisdom, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] believed that it was possible to set up a permanent settlement in Vinland. He believed it could be done, if the settlers were resourceful, well-funded, and worked together with native allies."
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] family had been involved in the Greenland colony for many years. By this point, the colony was prosperous and stable thanks to the walrus trade, and locals had occasionally sent expeditions to the far west to acquire resources and engage in trade with the native locals. Using [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] connections, with both those living in or involved with Greenland, as well as the native allies and trade partners in the far west, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] carefully scouted the coastlines of Vinland to find the perfect place to settle. Though it took time, thanks to [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.HighGodNamePossessive] guidance, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] found a peaceful glade by the coast, where grew some of the famed grapes and self-sown wheat of Vinland."
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_chapter_extra_deed_new_title: "It took more time, if not years, to bring in more settlers and ensure the colony would survive where other attempts failed. The hardy [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'culture' ).Culture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] who made up the majority of the settlers did their best to survive and be self-sufficient, while maintaining good relations with their native allies. Though it was difficult, the colony began to thrive, and a new dawn arrived on Vinland."
 RICE_vinland_settlement_success_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "There were those who doubted [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] foolhardy adventure into Vinland. Indeed, many others had failed before. However, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was not like the others. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] was a true child of the ever-connected, ever-prospering world of the North Atlantic, the kind of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetWomanMan] who could make the Vinland colony succeed. While it is unlikely Vinland will ever become a major player on the world stage, like Greenland, the story of how it bridged together the peoples across two continents, thanks to the pioneering, adventurous spirit of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], will be told for generations to come."

Three are through ending [decisions|E]: two #P good#! endings which are $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_integration_decision$ and $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_indigenous_decision$, and one #N bad#! ending which is to $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_abandonment_decision$.

It can be interacted with once a [ruler|E] who is [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_vinland$.\n\nDue to its remoteness and the lack of lucrative resources (unlike in [greenland|E]), colonizing Vinland is extremely difficult if the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] has not been resolved with a good ending.

 north_atlantic.0090.info:0 "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! There is clear genetic, historical, and literary evidence that modern-day Icelanders have a significant amount of Gaelic ancestry. Roughly more than 50% of the women and at least 20% of the men involved in the initial settlement of Iceland may have been of Gaelic origin, and while many were probably slaves or servants, it is not implausible that a sizeable minority of them came as free men and women. Given the Norse raided and enslaved many all over Europe, it is possible people from other regions of Europe were part of the initial settlement of Iceland as well.\n\nA famous case of potential Gaelic ancestry would be Leif Erikson, who may have been distantly descended from Irish nobility. Another famous case is that of Melkorka, a supposed Irish princess who was taken as a concubine by an Icelandic chieftain. Her son, Olaf the Peacock, purportedly traveled to Ireland and was offered the throne by his grandfather, before going on various adventures.\n\nMany of these Gaelic men and women were assimilated (probably forcibly, in many cases) into Norse society, and it is likely that later Icelanders hid their Gaelic ancestry, if they had any, due to the shame of potentially being descended from lowly slaves. Still, they may have influenced Icelandic history and culture in more ways than one. For instance, they may have contributed to the early presence of Christianity in Iceland. Additionally, there is evidence that the Sagas, which are typically associated with the pagan Vikings despite being compiled by Christian Icelanders, may have borrowed ideas, motifs, and plotlines from Irish mythology and literature, even if none of the characters or deities are Gaelic per se."

Though now a firmly Christian land, the Church is still struggling to grow in my homeland [GetTitleByKey('d_iceland').GetNameNoTier].\n\nTo rectify this situation, [aldabert.GetTitledFirstName] appointed me as the first bishop of [GetTitleByKey('d_iceland').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] several years ago, in 1056, whether because of the ability I showed during my education, or because of my family's connections. Either way, it is now my goal as the first bishop of [GetTitleByKey('d_iceland').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] to ensure that the Church can prosper in this far-off land.\n\nI have great plans to build religious sites, educate a new generation of clergy, and do all I can to spread the glory of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] across the North Atlantic."

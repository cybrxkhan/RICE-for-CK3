It is built in the typical [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] manner, using our traditional mudbricks.\n\nAnyways, I have contacted the local mud masons’ guild about doing repairs. A master mason, after inspecting the area, says it should be no trouble to reinforce the existing mud structure, but after consulting with some [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], says it is clear that the malevolent forces of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] are present here.\n\nThe day the repairs are supposed to begin, the same master mason, along with several of his fellow masons and apprentices, bury several blessed relics next to the structure, before saying various incantations and prayers. “Benedictions are as important as the mud bricks themselves,” the mason told me afterwards."
 bozo.0050.a:0 "Thank you for your hard work, regardless."
 bozo.0051.t:0 "Secrets of the Mud Masons"
 bozo.0051.desc:0 "Mud masons are an ubiquitous part of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] society. It is they who build and maintain many of the buildings we use everyday.\n\nI am out on the road today, and pass by some mud masons who are in the process of constructing a large house for one of the locals. I observe them for some time as they perform daily blessing rituals.\n\nI cannot help but try to eavesdrop on their [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] recitations and prayers, yet I cannot make out any clear words. Alas, the mud masons are notoriously protective of their secret knowledge, and never reveal it to outsiders. I have heard that some masons even hide the secrets they learned from their masters from other fellow masons!"
 bozo.0051.a:0 "Their secrets must be powerful!"
 bozo.0051.b:0 "Maybe these rituals are all for show."
 bozo.0052.t:0 "A New Contract for Mud Masonry"
 bozo.0052.desc:0 "Most [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] families have a contract with a master mud mason, who is responsible for doing regular maintenance on the mud structures that make up many of our buildings.\n\nAlas, the master mason who my family had contracted out to for many years recently passed away. Traditionally, contracts pass from the master mason to his apprentice, who is typically a relative.\n\nI am in fact familiar with the new master mason, having observed him at work before. I have great confidence in his abilities, and he likewise assures me he will continue to honor his kinsman’s legacy by working hard to maintain my family’s buildings."
 bozo.0052.a:0 "I am sure you will do well."
 bozo.0053.t:0 "Protection for the Mud Buildings"
 bozo.0053.desc:0 "I need to construct a small structure in my residence complex, and have employed a number of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] masons to do the job. As expected, they perform a number of sacrifices, prayers, and other rituals before they start.\n\nHowever, the head mason informs me that the site could use some extra protection from benevolent spirits. If it is fine with me, I need to acquire some grain and animal bones, for the masons to bury them at the corners of the future building."
 bozo.0053.a:0 "We have enough protection already."
 bozo.0053.b:0 "It doesn’t hurt to be extra careful."
 bozo.0053.c:0 "I don’t condone non-[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] heathen practices!"

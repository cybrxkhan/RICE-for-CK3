The tradition is now extinct, but lives on in the significant influence it has on the modern Hadiya, regardless of religious affiliation."

 south_ethiopia.0048.desc:0 "Because #italic Gifaataa#! is a time dedicated to peace, harmony, and reconciliation, it is also a time when many people try to pay back their debts.\n\nNot too long ago, I lent some money and resources to a local commoner, and today, they wish to pay it back to me in the spirit of #italic Gifaataa#!."
 south_ethiopia.0048.a:0 "Thank you for paying me back."
 south_ethiopia.0048.b:0 "Please, let me forgive your debt."
 south_ethiopia.0049.t:0 "Reforming Oneself"
 south_ethiopia.0049.desc:0 "#italic Gifaataa#! is a time to look towards the future with optimism and hope, and because of that, a lot of people try to turn a new leaf and change bad habits or reform themselves.\n\nOne local, known for their terrible ways, claims they will reform and become a better person now. They will dedicate themselves to honoring the values and morals we all hold dear, and to pay heed to what [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] would want us to do."

 south_ethiopia.0050.desc:0 "There is no better time to look for prospective partners for marriage than #italic Gifaataa#!.

 south_ethiopia.0051.t:0 "Elders' Wisdom"
 south_ethiopia.0051.desc:0 "We wouldn’t be where we are without our elders, and the elders of previous generations. Occasions like #italic Gifaataa#! are an important time for us to meet with elders and to learn from them.\n\nI am currently sitting in one such meeting, where many of us have gathered around a few local elders. These wise old men and women impart their knowledge and wisdom to us, with the hope that we will make good use of it."
 south_ethiopia.0051.a:0 "They’ve given us many valuable insights."

The #italic ayyaanto#!, our most capable astrologers, have observed the movements of the moon and the five stars in the #italic buusa#! constellation to determine the best date for this year’s celebration.\n\nAfter the #italic ayyaanto#! have decided on the chosen date, I and other important leaders and elders in the community gathered to discuss how to organize the event. Once we finish discussing how to proceed with this year's festivities, we each go to the market in our respective settlements. There, we hang a sheep skin on a long spear, and proclaim the date of this year's #italic Fichee-Chambalaalla#! to the whole community."

In doing so, we are giving thanks to the earth for such food.\n\nOnce we’ve eaten some, we go to the houses of those near us, one by one, and share in the food."

As the sun slowly rises into the sky, children from the local village go about, as is tradition, to cheerfully wish everyone happy birthday, saying, “#italic Ayidde Chambalaalla!#!”\n\nIn turn, we respond with positive words, wishing the children many years of life, and giving the children more #italic buursame#!."

 south_ethiopia.0065.desc:0 "#italic Chambalaalla#!, and the week after it, filled with many events. There is the ritual of feeding cattle a salty soil called #italic boole#!, for instance.

I have prepared many words of advice to say to the community this year, on how we can promote good deeds, and prevent ourselves from committing bad deeds."

It is a very useful crop because it is resistant to drought, and can be harvested anytime and at any stage of its life.\n\nAs such, I have ordered for villages in my realm where enset is grown to harvest some of the enset now to ensure our food supplies are secure for the near future.\n\nSome might grumble at the prospect of having to harvest now, rather than later, when the plants are more mature.

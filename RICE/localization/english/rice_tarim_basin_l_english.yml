 # History Intros (Jesus Christ these are long)
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhang:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Following the Tang Dynasty's decline in the wake of the An Lushan rebellion of the mid-8th century, the Tibetan Empire conquered much of the former Tang dominions in Central Asia, including Dunhuang (or Shazhou). Zhang Yichao, a Han native of Dunhuang, led a successful revolt in 848 against the Tibetans; after years of campaigning, he restored much of the Hexi Corridor to Tang rule.\n\nYichao had a tense relationship with the Tang, and had to send his brother Yitan to the Tang court as a hostage in order to curry favor with them, as he needed every bit of help he could get to defend the frontier. When Yitan passed away, Yichao decided to replace him as hostage, leaving his nephew Huaishen in charge.\n\nHuaishen’s reign was more tumultuous, as a number of his uncle’s gains were lost, and there was little improvement in the Guiyi Circuit's relationship with the Tang. Eventually, Huaishen died under uncertain circumstances around 890. He was probably killed by either one of his relatives, and/or an ambitious official such as Suo Xun."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.cao:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Though the Cao were a well-established clan in Dunhuang, it is possible their most famous member, Cao Yijin, was actually of distant Sogdian origin. If this is true, he might have wanted to emphasize a connection with the more famous Cao to bolster his immediate family's prestige.\n\nRegardless, Yijin was originally a senior official of Zhang Yichao, the liberator of Dunhuang. He usurped power from the Zhang family by 914, but unlike the coups by other Dunhuang clans, his was more successful and permanent.\n\nYijin inherited a Guiyi greatly reduced in power and size. Nonetheless, he was a capable ruler: he maintained strategic marriage alliances with Kingdom of Khotan and the Uyghurs of Guazhou, working to earn the trust of Dunhuang’s elite clans, developing agriculture, patronizing major Buddhist religious projects, and so on. After he passed away in 935, his family would remain in power until the fall of the Guiyi Circuit to Western Xia in 1036."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.suo:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Suo were one of the oldest clans in Dunhuang, descended from a Jin Dynasty scholar and official named Suo Jing (239-303), who is one of the most important figures in the history of Chinese calligraphy.\n\nWith such an illustrious pedigree, the Suo were considered one of the most influential Dunhuang clans - a contemporary source lists the Suo as the first rank among the major Dunhuang families, and many served Zhang Yichao’s as officials or generals. One of them, Suo Zhongxin, was a close attendant of Yichao; another, Suo Xun, was his son-in-law.\n\nYichao’s nephew and successor, Huaishen, died in unusual circumstances in 890. A leading theory for his death is that he was murdered by Suo Xun, perhaps together with Yichao’s son Huaiding, as the two may have shared power for a while until Huaiding’s death. Xun ruled on his own for a couple more years, until he himself was killed in a counter-coup in 894 by the sons of Li Mingzhen, another son-in-law of Yichao.\n\nNonetheless, the Suo continued to play a role in Dunhuang politics. For example, one of their members, the official Suo Ziquan, led a major delegation to the King of Khotan in 956."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.li:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Longxi Li were a branch of the Li family based in modern-day Gansu province. Their scions included the famed Han Dynasty general Li Guang, his grandson the tragic traitor Li Ling, and the Tang Dynasty itself. In Dunhuang, they played a major role in the region’s politics for centuries. For example, an ancestor of the Tang Emperors, Li Gao, founded the short-lived Western Liang dynasty that ruled Dunhuang from 400 to 421.\n\nThe Li clan were staunch supporters of Zhang Yichao, the liberator of Dunhuang, and his family. At the time, their foremost representative was Li Mingzhen, a son-in-law of Yichao. He served as Yichao’s envoy to the Tang court at one point, using his alleged shared ancestry with the Tang Emperors to increase his credibility and convince them to give Yichao the coveted title of #italic jiedushi#! or military governor.\n\nMingzhen’s relatives also had key roles in Dunhuang, such as two of his brothers had important posts in the Guiyi Army, one of whom, Mingda, accompanied him during his trip to the Tang court. Meanwhile, after Mingzhen's death in 890, his four sons would launch a counter-coup against Suo Xun and restore the region to Zhang rule."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhai:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Zhai clan had a presence in Dunhuang by the 6th century. A certain Zhai Tong, styled Siyuan, patronized the construction of Mogao Cave 220 in the year 642 during the early Tang Dynasty. This cave is one of the earliest known caves at Mogao dedicated solely as a family shrine, and one of the few caves that can be dated relatively reliably. Over the course of three hundred years, the cave went through several reconstructions by Siyuan’s descendants.\n\nDuring Zhang Yichao’s rule, a prominent member of the Zhai clan was Zhai Farong, a monk and physician who served as chief of the Buddhist monastic community in the entire Hexi region. A relative of his, Xin (or Huaxin), would later serve the Zhang family as a minor official.\n\nXin’s son was Fengda, a 9th-generation descendant of Siyuan who would become the Zhai clan’s most famous scion. As an important official of the Cao dynasty in the 900s, he was noted for his intellectual pursuits, particularly in astronomy."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.yin:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Yin clan were active in Dunhuang since at least the 4th century. During the Former Liang dynasty (320–376), at some point they raised the ire of Former Liang’s founder, Zhang Gui, resulting in the death of a prominent member of the family, Yin Jian. Jian’s brother, Yin Dan, served as governor of Dunhuang at some point as well.\n\nRegardless, the Yin family continued to thrive in Dunhuang over the centuries, involving themselves in the region’s politics. For example, they were stalwart supporters of Empress Wu Zetian during her reign; according to legend, a scion of the Yin family dreamt of various auspicious signs affirming the legitimacy and greatness of her rule.\n\nBy the Guiyi period, they also played a role in assisting Zhang Yichao reclaim Dunhuang from the Tibetans. Yin Wentong, a son-in-law of Yichao, was one of his major generals for example. Another member of the family, Jifeng, would later become governor of Liangzhou."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhang_wenche:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Zhang Wenche was a poet and one of the two officials sent to lead a group of envoys to the Tang Dynasty in 887 CE on behalf of Guiyi's ruler, Zhang Huaishen. The other was Song Runying.\n\nThe envoys’ mission was to ask the Tang to formally bestow on their liege the important title of #italic jiedushi#!, and legitimize his rule in light of the region's deteriorating political situation. When the Tang court dragged their feet about it for weeks, the envoys got into a fight - Runying argued they had to be patient; Wenche argued it was pointless, and he furthermore insulted Huaishen as an inept lord who didn't deserve the title. Either way, the group returned empty handed.\n\nThere is a theory Wenche was the one who actually ordered Huaishen's assassination in 892, and not Suo Xun, who usurped power afterwards. Wenche became prime minister for a later ruler of Guiyi, Huaishen's kinsman Chengfeng, and helped persuade his liege to proclaim himself Emperor in 910 after the fall of the Tang. This failed disastrously when the Uyghurs attacked; a humiliated Chengfeng had to downgrade to a king, before being usurped by Cao Yijin. By then, Wenche had passed away."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.song_runying:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Song Runying was an official in Guiyi who was one of the two officials sent to lead a group of envoys to the Tang Dynasty in 887 CE on behalf of Guiyi's ruler, Zhang Huaishen. The other was Zhang Wenche.\n\nThe envoys’ mission was to ask the Tang to formally bestow on their liege the important title of #italic jiedushi#!, and legitimize his rule in light of the region's deteriorating political situation.

Either way, the group returned empty handed."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.yan:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Like many elite clans in Dunhuang, the Yan family were both collaborators and resistors to the Tibetan Empire after it conquered the Hexi Corridor from the Tang.\n\nThis paradoxical relationship can perhaps be seen through the career of the family’s most famous member, the general Yan Chao, who organized major resistance to the Tibetan invasion in the 770s and 780s. With aid from the Tang government not forthcoming, he surrenders to the Tibetans on the condition that Dunhuang was spared from any looting and destruction. The Tibetans likely remained suspicious of Yan Chao, as they poisoned him when he was making his way to formally pay homage to the Tibetan leadership in Lhasa.\n\nYan Yingda, the most prominent member of the clan in Zhang Yichao’s regime, started off as the highest ranking Chinese official under the Tibetans in the early 9th century. He ended up contributing to Zhang Yichao’s uprising, however, and was appointed prefect of Guazhou at some point."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.gao_jinda:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Gao Jinda was a military commander serving under Zhang Yichao during his uprising against the Tibetans. After the rebellion’s success, Yichao sent Jinda to report the victory to the Tang court. It is uncertain how many delegations Yichao sent and when, but Jinda’s group was likely the first one.\n\nInterestingly, Jinda was accompanied by a small escort of only ten soldiers, despite the dangers they faced along the way. Parts of the Hexi Corridor were still controlled by Tibetan warlords battling in the wake of the Tibetan Empire’s collapse, so Jinda and his team had to use a roundabout route through the desert to reach Tang territory in a journey that took two years.\n\nAlas, their trip must have ended in disappointment, as the Tang court did not appear elated at the news, as they only conferred on Zhang Yichao the relatively worthless title of “Defender of Shazhou,” perhaps as a courtesy acknowledgement of his accomplishments. Yichao would only receive the coveted title of #italic jiedushi#! or military governor when he sent a later team of envoys headed by brother Yitan, the famed monk Wuzhen, and Li Mingzhen, a distant relative of the Tang Emperors."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.sogdian:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Sogdians, an East Iranian people famed for their skills in trade, had a major presence in Dunhuang and the Hexi Corridor in the ancient and medieval period. Many rose to prominence in Dunhuang elite society and played a role in the Guiyi Circuit’s government and military.\n\nAn Jingmin, for example, must have been a Sogdian of some importance as he was involved in Zhang Yichao’s uprising and appointed vice-commissioner of the Guiyi Circuit, and thus second in command to Yichao.\n\nThe Kang were another prominent Sogdian family in Dunhuang. Their main representatives in Yichao’s regime included officials such as Kang Tongxin, a magistrate of several towns in the eastern Hexi Corridor, and Kang Shijun, who served as prefect of Guazhou at some point."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.wenmo:0 "As [ruler|E] of the Wenmo, you start off with some [special_troops|E].\n\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Wenmo, also known as the Wamo or Hunmo, have ambiguous origins but are likely the descendants of slaves of Chinese ancestry and other ethnicities in under Tibetans during the Tibetan occupation of the Gansu region.\n\nThe development of the Wenmo identity has been described as analogous to the Creoles or Maroons in the Americas. The Wenmo were a thorn on the side of the Guiyi Circuit, and established an independent regime in Liangzhou by 884.\n\nZhebu Yun here is fictitious, though the Zhebu were a major Wenmo tribe. Their most important member was Zhebu Jiashi, who became leader of Liangzhou in 948-949. In 1004, another Zhebu, Zhebu Youlongbo, surrendered Liangzhou to the rising Tanguts, predecessors of the Western Xia state."

The princess led her people to safety despite the cowardice of her brother the king, and aspired that China would come to Khotan’s aid.\n\nSuch stories tell us clearly that no matter if one is male or female, that anyone can perform meritorious deeds and save others."

At the time, there was nothing but a large lake.

Before she arrived in the city of Khotan, she deposited the seeds and eggs at a site that would later become Mashe Monastery.\n\nWho knows if this legend is true! But it is certainly one that many locals find interesting."

In the past, there was a child who got lost near Gomati, the city’s greatest monastery. The concerned king led many people in searching the area for the child, and they stumbled upon a small valley by the hill of Gautośan. They were amazed to discover a #italic stupa#! containing relics of Kasyapa, the last Buddha before the historical Buddha. Recognizing the location’s sacred nature, the King ordered the construction of what is now known as Gautośan monastery.\n\nAs the chief Khotanese monasteries, Gomati and Gautośan are said to be the site of many heavenly signs and miracles, so it's little wonder they have such a wondrous history."

One of the most notable was the so-called Udayana statue. The young king Udayana was a faithful follower and contemporary of the Buddha, who had a sandalwood statue of the Buddha carved. This statue acquired miraculous abilities, such as bowing to or engaging in dialogue with the Buddha. It eventually flew to a location near Khotan known as Pimo, and to this day, Pimo remains a popular area of pilgrimage for locals.\n\nI am only fortunate that I have found the opportunity to quickly visit Pimo itself during this time."

For example, he was proud of his Turkic heritage, and cautioned his fellow Turks against adopting a sedentary lifestyle, as he believed their old, nomadic ways were superior. He also expressed hostility towards Buddhist and pagan beliefs.\n\nAt any rate, Kashgari was supposedly related to the rulers of the Karakhanid dynasty; such a connection is not entirely proven, but it is plausible. If he was of Karakhanid descent, his ancestor might have been one Hussayn or Hasan, who conquered the Samanid capital Bukhara in 992 CE.

She had her son, [ali_arslan.GetFirstName], with none other than Saint Gabriel.\n\nLater, this brave woman went into battle herself against the infidels, showing that anyone, no matter if they are men or women, can fight in the name of righteousness and justice.

The Emperor subsequently executed the Empress. Prince Jun was demoted and later killed in 1077.\n\nYixin's downfall began shortly after he tried and failed to assassinate Daozong's grandson and Jun's son, the future Emperor Tianzuo.

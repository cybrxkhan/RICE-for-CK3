 game_concept_historical_aspirations_desc:2 "$game_concept_historical_aspirations$ are simple, optional quests available to certain historical [characters|E] at game start. Unlike Achievements, these aspiraitons grants various bonuses upon completion, such as [modifiers|E] or @dynasty_prestige_icon! [dynasty_prestige|E].\n\nAspirations generally reflect the specific historical circumstances and motives the character, rather than grand possibilities or hypotheticals, and are meant to encourage players to roleplay that character's real life desires and experiences.\n\nAspirations consist of two types of objectives. [historical_aspiration_main_objectives|E] satisfied in order to fulfill the aspiration. [historical_aspiration_bonus_objectives|E], conversely, do not need to be satisfied, but doing so nets you extra bonuses. Objectives can be direct actions, such as taking a [decision|E], or passive, such as following a certain [religion|E].\n\nIt is important to note that Aspiration completion is calculated at the #V beginning#! of the year, and not immediately. In other words, if you meet the objectives at the start of the year, then you'll fulfill the aspiration. This means you may have a bit of grace time to accomplish bonus objectives."

 # Culture
 VIETNAMESE_GLOSS: "The #bold Vietnamese#! are an ethnic group native to the country of Vietnam. During the timeframe of Crusader Kings, the ancestors of the modern Vietnamese, around the Red River Delta, often referred to themselves as the #bold Kinh#! people, or Jīng (京) in Chinese. The Kinh arose from speakers of Vietic languages who were Sinicized to a heavy extent over the centuries, and speakers of Chinese in Vietnam who assimilated into the Kinh. The Kinh contrast with other Vietic peoples, particularly the Mường, who were less Sinicized and remained in the highland regions of northern Vietnam."
 DORSET_GLOSS: "The #bold Dorset#! were a Paleo-Eskimo culture that inhabited parts of northern Canada and Greenland starting around 500 BCE until somewhere between 1000 to 1500 CE. They do not appear to have any genetic connection with the Thule culture, the ancestors of the modern-day Inuit, who replaced them in the area. Inuit legends speak of encounters with a so-called #bold Tuniit#! peoples, large giants who were afraid to interact with and fight the Norse; the Tuniit may correspond to the Dorset peoples. There may have also been some contact between the Dorset and the Norse settlers in Greenland, though this is debated."
 INUIT_GLOSS: "The ancestors of the modern-day #bold Inuit#!, known archaeologically as the #bold Thule#! culture, arose in Alaska around the year 1000 and expanded eastwards into Canada and Greenland by the 13th century, replacing the previous inhabitants, the Dorset culture, who may correspond to the Tuniit, a race of giants in Inuit legends. There is limited evidence for contact between these proto-Inuit and the Norse settlers in Greenland, though the extent of this is debated. For instance, there are Inuit legends about the Norse, but these stories were recorded much later in the 19th century and may have also reflected then contemporary Inuit attitudes towards European colonization."
 LAURENTIAN_GLOSS: "The #bold $laurentian_collective_noun$#! refer to the Saint Lawrence Iroquoians, the native Iroquoian-speaking inhabitants of the Saint Lawrence River from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far inland as Lake Ontario. They were encountered by Europeans occasionally in the 1500s — the French explorer Jacques Cartier visited two villages of Saint Lawrence Iroquoians, #italic Stadacona#! and #italic Hocelaga#!, for example — but disappeared soon after; the reasons for their demise are uncertain and debated. Regardless, as we do not know what they called themselves, they are called $laurentian$ in-game as the legends of the $mikmaq$ people speak of at times violent encounters with a group they called the $laurentian_collective_noun$ that seem to correspond to the Saint Lawrence Iroquoians."
 INNU_GLOSS: "The #bold $innu_collective_noun$#! are the native, Algonquian-speaking peoples of present-day Labrador and parts of Quebec, who were traditionally nomadic hunter-gatherers and fishers. In the past, they were referred to as the #bold Montagnais#! by Europeans (meaning 'Mountain People' in French), but prefer the term $innu$ (meaning 'human' in the Innu-aimun language)."
 EAST_CREE_GLOSS: "The #bold $east_cree_collective_noun$#! represent the easternmost members of the #bold Nehinaw#! (or #bold Cree#!), the native, Algonquian-speaking peoples of much of Canada. Known as #bold Cree#! to European colonists, they are spread across a wide area of Canada from Labrador to Alberta, and played a major role in the North American fur trade."
 MIKMAQ_GLOSS: "The #bold $mikmaq_collective_noun$#! are an Algonquian-speaking peoples native to Canada's Atlantic provinces, primarily Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. They were part of the #italic Wabanaki Confederacy#!, a major confederation of five Algonquian nations that formed in the 17th century and included the $mikmaq$, $maliseet$, $passamaquoddy$, $penobscot$, and $abenaki$."
 MALISEET_GLOSS: "The #bold $maliseet_collective_noun$#! are an Algonquian-speaking peoples native to New Brunswick, Quebec, and Maine. In the past, they were referred to as the #bold Maliseet#! by Europeans, based on the $mikmaq$ exonym #italic Malesse'jik#! meaning 'He speaks slowly'; their preferred term for themselves, $maliseet$, means 'People of the Bright River.' They were part of the #italic Wabanaki Confederacy#!, a major confederation of five Algonquian nations that formed in the 17th century and included the $maliseet$, $mikmaq$, $passamaquoddy$, $penobscot$, and $abenaki$."
 PASSAMAQUODDY_GLOSS: "The #bold $passamaquoddy_collective_noun$#! are an Algonquian-speaking peoples native to New Brunswick, Quebec, and Maine. In the past, they were referred to as the #bold Passamaquoddy#! by Europeans, an Anglization of their endonym, $passamaquoddy$, which means 'those who place where pollock are plentiful,' reflecting the importance of fish in their culture. They were part of the #italic Wabanaki Confederacy#!, a major confederation of five Algonquian nations that formed in the 17th century and included the $passamaquoddy$, $mikmaq$, $maliseet$, $penobscot$, and $abenaki$."
 PENOBSCOT_GLOSS: "The #bold $penobscot_collective_noun$#! are an Algonquian-speaking peoples native to New Brunswick, Quebec, and Maine. In the past, they were referred to as the #bold Penobscot#! by Europeans based on a mishearing of their endonym, $penobscot$, which means 'the people of where the white rocks extend out.' They were part of the #italic Wabanaki Confederacy#!, a major confederation of five Algonquian nations that formed in the 17th century and included the $penobscot$, $mikmaq$, $maliseet$, $passamaquoddy$, and $abenaki$."
 ABENAKI_GLOSS: "The #bold $abenaki_collective_noun$#! are an Algonquian-speaking peoples native to New Brunswick, Quebec, and Maine. $abenaki$ means 'Real People,' though they are also known as #bold Abenaki#!, which is derived from the #italic Wabanaki Confederacy#! that they were part of. The #italic Wabanaki#! were a major confederation of five Algonquian nations that formed in the 17th century and included the $abenaki$, $mikmaq$, $maliseet$, $passamaquoddy$, and $penobscot$."
 BEOTHUK_GLOSS: "The #bold $beothuk_collective_noun$#! were the native inhabitants of Newfoundland. Their language, which went extinct in the 19th century, may have been related to the Algonquian langauges, but due to lack of data, this is uncertain. Norse explorers may have encountered them or their ancestors c. 1000 CE, but their first confirmed encounters with Europeans date to the 16th century. Due to European encroachment, slaughter, and diseases to which they had no natural resistance, the $beothuk$ declined rapidly following contact. The last known full $beothuk$ person, a woman named Shawnadithit, died in 1829, but other $beothuk_collective_noun$ likely survived by finding refuge among other nearby indigenous groups such as the $mikmaq$."

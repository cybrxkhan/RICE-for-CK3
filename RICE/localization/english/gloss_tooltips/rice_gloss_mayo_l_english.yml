 SCOTTI_GLOSS: "The Gaelic-speaking peoples, including the ancestors of the modern-day Irish, were called the #bold Scotti#! in late antiquity and the early medieval period. During this period, Ireland was known as #italic Scotia Maior#!, while Scotland was called #italic Scotia Minor#!. The association of the word Scot with Scotland, and not the Gaels overall or the Irish, would be a later medieval development."
 PERIPHYSEON_GLOSS: "The #bold Periphyseon#!, called the 'final achievement of ancient philosophy' is considered the magnum opus of John Scottus Eriugena, one of the most brilliant Christian intellectuals of the 9th century. It syncretizes and develops on the ideas of many different ancient strands of thought in a Christian context, to the point where it was condemend by some later Christian theologial authorities for promoting overly pantheistic and Neoplatonic ideals, even though Eriugena considered himself an orthodox opponent of heresy. The book is also known as #italic De divisione naturae#!, a Latin name given to it by the 17th century English antiquarian Thomas Gale who published the first printed version of the text."

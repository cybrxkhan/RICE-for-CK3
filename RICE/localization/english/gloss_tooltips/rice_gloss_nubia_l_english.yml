 LORD_OF_THE_MOUNTAIN_GLOSS: "The #bold Lord of the Mountain#! (#italic Migin Soñoj#! in medieval Nubian) or #bold Eparch of Nobatia#! was arguably the highest-ranking official in Makuria, the northern kingdom of medieval Nubia. His chief responsibility was managing the frontier between Nubia and Egypt, and carrying out the provisions of the Baqt treaty on the Nubian side as the counterpart of the Egyptian Governor of Aswan. Currently, scholars are unsure whether the office was hereditary, appointed, or a combination of both, and whether the Eparchs had any connections with the rulers of the earlier kingdom of Nobatia that was absorbed into Makuria at some point by the 7th century."
 GOVERNOR_OF_ASWAN_GLOSS: "Historically, in medieval Egypt, the #bold Governors of Aswan#! had a major responsibility in managing the frontier between Nubia and Egypt, and carrying out the provisions of the Baqt treaty on the Egyptian side, as the counterpart of the Nubian Eparch of Nobatia."
 PHARAOH_GLOSS: "The term #bold Pharaoh#! originally referred to Ancient Egypt's royal palace, but during the New Kingdom (c. 16th-11th centuries BCE), the word came to be metonymically used to refer to the rulers of Egypt. It was never used as a formal title for Egypt's monarchs, and such usage derives from the Hebrew Bible. In reality, the Pharaohs were typically given five names by the Middle Kingdom: the Horus name, Nebty name, Golden Horus name, nomen, and prenomen."
 QORE_GLOSS: "#bold Qore#! or #bold Kore#! was the title of the rulers of the Kingdom of Kush, in ancient Nubia, particularly during the Meroitic period (542 BCE - c. 350 CE) when the capital of Kush was at Meroe. The title could be held by both male and female rulers."
 KANDAKE_GLOSS: "#bold Kandake#! or #bold Candace#! was the title of the queen mothers or queen regnants of the Kingdom of Kush, in ancient Nubia, particularly during the Meroitic period (542 BCE - c. 350 CE) when the capital of Kush was at Meroe. The term survived in the Bible to refer to a purported queen of the so-called Aethiopians, and in medieval legends of Alexander the Great as the name of a queen he fought against in Nubia. As a result, it has survived nowadays as a common name in the West."
 HAFIR_GLOSS: "#bold Hafirs#! are a kind of artificially constructed water reservoir first built by the Kingdom of Kush in ancient Nubia, that are still used to this day. Many of the earlier hafirs were built next to Kushite temples, and may have been associated with religious and royal authority and power."
 ARCHANGEL_RAPHAEL_GLOSS: "#bold Raphael#! is one of the most esteemed archangels in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Originally mentioned in the #italic Book of Tobit#! and the #italic Book of Enoch#!, Raphael is unnamed in the New Testament and Quran. However, later Christian tradition identified him with healing, and in Islam, he is believed to be the unnamed angel who stands eternally with a trumpet to his lips, ready to announce the Day of Judgment."
 XENODOCHIUM_GLOSS: "A #bold Xenodochium#! or #bold Xenodocheion#! (plural #italic xenoocheia#!) was a hostel for travelers, particularly pilgrims, in the medieval period. The term, originating from Greek, is used for such hostels originating from the Byzantine Empire or Christian regions influenced by it like Nubia."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_ASHITINAME_OF_MUHAMMAD: "The #bold Ashitiname of Muhammad#!, also known as the Convenant or Testament of Muhammad, is a charter granting protection and other privileges to the Christian monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai. The original version of the document was supposedly seized by the Ottomans for safekeeping when they conquered Egypt, though a copy was made to the monks of Saint Catherine's Monastery as compensation, and the Ottomans nonetheless upheld the charter's provisions."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_BEDOUIN_GUARDS: "The Christian Monastery of Saint Catherine in the Sinai has historically relied on #bold Bedouin guards#! for protection. Over the centuries, while the monastery was often raided and pillaged by Muslim forces, some of the monastery's fiercest guardians were also Muslim as well."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_BURNING_BUSH: "The #bold Burning Bush#! was, in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim tradition, the location in the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses was appointed by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. During Late Antiquity, the famed Monastery of Saint Catherine was built around a bush that is purportedly the same as the Biblical burning bush."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_LIBRARY: "The #bold library#! of Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai was built during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian, sometime between 527 and 565 CE, and is recognized as one of the world's oldest continuously operating libraries. Over the centuries, it accumulated a vast collection of manuscripts and books in a variety of languages, including but not limited to Greek, Aramaic, Syriac, Latin, Arabic, Armenian, Ge'ez, Church Slavonic, Georgian, Hebrew, and Coptic."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_PATH_OF_MOSES: "Next to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai is a route known as the #bold Path of Moses#!, that goes up a mountain where it is believed that the Biblical Moses received the Ten Commandments."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_RELICS: "Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai is associated with Saint Catherine because her purported #bold relics#! were discovered close to the monastery and brought there for safekeeping, turning it into a popular pilgrimage site as a result. In traditional hagiography, she was a young scholarly woman who converted many to Christianity, before being martyred around 305 CE."
 SAINT_CATHERINE_WELL_OF_MOSES: "Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai encloses the purported #bold Well of Moses#!, where the Biblical Moses is said to have met his future wife, Zipporah, the daughter of the Jethro, the priest and prince of Midian. Even into the modern day, the well is the monastery's main source of water."
 SAQIA_GLOSS: "#bold Saqia#! (also spelled #bold Saqiya#! or #bold Sakia#!) is a mechanical water lifting device that consists of buckets or jars fastened to a vertical wheel or a rope belt about the wheel, which in turn is attached by a shaft to a horizontal wheel turned by horses, oxen, or donkeys. This form of irrigation has been in use in the Middle East, India, and North Africa for centuries. In many places, the saqia are supported by several different local shareholders, who agree to equally contribute the necessary materials or perform repairs on the saqia, and in turn each shareholder receives an equal period of irrigation for their own field."
 TEBELDI_TREES_GLOSS: "#bold Tebeldi#! is the name used in parts of Sudan to refer to #italic Adansonia digitata#!, the most widespread species of baobab trees, which are native to much of Africa and parts of Yemen and Oman. Traditionally, it was valued as a source of food, water, and medicine. In Darfur, local rulers had a sacred obligation to protect these trees, as they were considered a crucial source of water, since the trees are useful for water storage."
 NOTARIOS_GLOSS: "In ancient Rome and Byzantium, #bold notarios#! was typically a title given to low-ranking officials or scribes with clerical or secretarial duties. The title spread throughout regions influenced by Rome and Byzantium, such as western Europe and Nubia, where the term retained a similar meaning."
 SHOUNG_GLOSS: "The #bold Keeper of Granaries#!, or #bold Shoung#! in medieval Nubian, was a title attested for some high-ranking Makurian officials in medieval Nubia. Scholars are unsure about the duties or functions associated with the title, or if it was a ceremonial one. Curiously, one Makurian king from the late 12th century, Basil, is attested as holding this title, while he was #italic also#! king, unlike other holders of this title who were non-royal officials."
 NUBIA_RELEASED_THE_BOATS_GLOSS: "Traffic traveling to and from Nubia and Egypt was carefully monitored by officials from both sides during this period. This excerpt comes from a letter involving the Eparch of Nobatia in Nubia, reflecting how merchants' ships, for instance, needed his permission to operate in Nubia and travel back and forth."
 NUBIA_THE_KING_GLOSS: "The excerpt comes from a letter where one Muslim merchant, Lami' ibn Hasan al-Kanzi, complains to the Eparch of Nobatia that his slave boy, who he perhaps used as a messenger or to take care of some sort of business related to the Makurian king, was impeded in some way by a rival Muslim merchant, Ibn al-'Asqalani. Both men appear to have had connections with the Makurian king."
 NUBIA_COLD_SEASON_GLOSS: "A common means of travel for merchants traveling up and down the Nile during the medieval era was via boat. At times, the navigation of the river could be impeded in the cold season due to the wind, so as this excerpt from a letter by a Muslim merchant to the Eparch of Nobatia implies, these merchants had to time their business carefully based on the time of year."
 NUBIA_COLD_SEASON_2_GLOSS: "A common means of travel for merchants traveling up and down the Nile during the medieval era was via boat. At times, the navigation of the river could be impeded in the cold season due to the wind, so merchants had to time their business carefully based on the time of year."
 NUBIA_IN_THE_PRESENCE_OF_GLOSS: "This excerpt comes from a letter from a Muslim person to the Eparch of Nobatia in Makuria. The use of 'in the presence of the Bishop' (in the original version) is intended to give whatever is happening legal sanction, based on the practice of legal acts being done in the presence of witnesses or a judge in medieval Islamic law. Similarly, in medieval Nubia, legal documents were often signed in the presence of various secular and ecclesiastical officials, too. This passage also suggests that obligations between two parties in this frontier context could be between individual parties, and wasn't just only between two governments, i.e. the kingdoms of Egypt and Makuria."
 NUBIA_KISSES_THE_GROUND: "This excerpt comes from a letter from a Muslim person to the Eparch of Nobatia, and makes use of the obeisance formula “the slave kisses the ground” that is commonly found in these kinds of letters sent to certain officials or rulers in Nubia and Egypt. This formula obviously does not literally mean the writer is a slave of the addressee; it was a formulaic show of respect initially introduced in Egypt that reflected a development in Fatimid court protocol, where someone would kiss the ground in the presence of the Fatimid Caliph."
 NUBIA_RISING_OF_PRICES_GLOSS: "This excerpt comes from a letter alluding to the Eparch of Nobatia's apparent intervention in some sort of economic crisis by granting permission for the shipment of supplies."
 SUNT_GLOSS: "#bold Sunt#! is the Arabic word for the flowering tree species #italic Vachellia nilotica#! or #italic Acacia nilotica#!, known by the vernacular names of the #italic gum arabic tree#!, #italic babul#!, #italic thorn mimosa#!, #italic Egyptian acacia#!, and #italic thorny acacia#!. It was traditionally used to build ships throughout the Nile river, thanks to the relative impenetrability of its wood, and how a body of the boat could be quickly and easily built using smaller #italic sunt#! pieces."
 ERA_OF_THE_HEGIRA_GLOSS: "The #bold Era of the Hegira#! (in Greek/Latin) or #bold Hijri#! (in the original Arabic) is the calendar era used for recording dates in the Islamic world. It begins in the year when the Prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina in an event known as the Hijri, corresponding to 622 CE. At times, its use spread to non-Muslim communities who were ruled or influenced by Islamic states, or had economic and cultural connections with Muslims."
 ERA_OF_THE_MARTYRS_GLOSS: "The #bold Era of the Martyrs#!, also known as the #bold Diocletian Era#!, is the calendar era used for recording dates used by some early Christians. It starts on the reign of the Roman Emperor Diocletian in 284 CE, who initiated the last major persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Though it was abandoned in favor of the #italic Anno Domini#! era in much of the Christian world by the Middle Ages, it continued to be used by the Coptic Church based in Egypt to this day."
 SAYINGS_OF_THE_DESERT_FATHERS_GLOSS: "The #bold Sayings of the Desert Fathers#!, dating to around the 5th century, are various textual collections of anecdotes and sayings of the Desert Fathers of Egypt, who were a number of influential hermits and ascetics who played a major role in the development of Christianity. These collections were popular among medieval Coptic monks as a source of spiritual guidance."
 ABBA_POEMEN_GLOSS: "#bold Abba Poemen#! (c. 340-450 CE) was a Christian monk, Desert Father, and saint from Egypt. He is the most quoted Abba, or Father, in the #italic Sayings of the Desert Fathers#!, a collection of anecdotes and sayings of the Desert Fathers."
 OIKONOMOS_GLOSS: "The title of #bold oikonomos#! originates from the ancient Greek world, and evolved over the centuries to have different meanings, though it was always connected with the administration of something – whether a private house, an estate, a temple, a political state, and so on – in a Mediterranean context. By Late Antiquity, in the Mediterranean, it typically meant the steward of a church or monastery. The title even spread as far as Nubia, due to Byzantine influence; though most scholars are unsure of the duties of various Nubian administrative titles, it is likely that the Nubian oikonomos was also some sort of ecclesiastical steward."
 SAINT_EPIMACHOS_GLOSS: "While there are different saints named #bold Epimachos#!, or #bold Epimachus#!, the one popularly revered in medieval Nubia was Epimachos of Pelusium, a weaver who was, in hagiographical accounts, martyred at some unknown point during a period of Christian persecution in Roman Egypt. Although his original story had little connection to the military, in Nubia, he was portrayed as a warrior-saint. It is unknown whether he acquired this aspect due to his name including the Greek word for battle, #italic mákhē#!, or because of some local miracle that is lost to us. The cult of Epimachos, as a warrior, was fairly widespread in medieval Nubia, possibly reflecting worries about military threats to Nubia, or political instability."
 SOULOU_GLOSS: "The meaning of the word #bold soulou#!, which appears in a few medieval Nubian documents, has baffled Nubianologists for years. It is an excellent example of the difficulty in translating many of these texts which we often don't have the context of. The #italic Soulou#! appear to have worked for officials to deliver messages, but it is unknown if they were an actual job title, a social class, an ethnic group employed for this purpose, or something else. #italic Soulou#! might correspond to the word #italic sulu#! in the modern Nubian languages, which refers to shoemakers who are mobile workers. However, a recent scholarly paper by Petra Weschenfelder on the term #italic Soulou#! recommends it is best we leave it untranslated for now until further information is found."
 KITAB_AJA_IB_AL_HIND_GLOSS: "The #bold Kitāb ʿajāʾib al-Hind#!, or #italic "The Book of the Marvels of India"#!, is a tenth century collection of the adventurous tales of merchants, sailors, and travelers written by Buzurg ibn Shahriyār, an Arab sea captain. It was dedicated to an Ikhishidid governor of Egypt, Abu al-Misk Kafur (905 - 968 CE), who was originally an African slave serving the Ikhshidids but rose through the ranks to become #italic de facto#! ruler of Egypt as vizier before becoming sole ruler in 966."
 SAINT_HILARIA_GLOSS: "The #bold Legend of Saint Hilaria#! was Coptic text that tells of a legend about the elder daughter of Zeno, a 5th century Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the legend, Hilaria was greatly inspired by the monks in the Egyptian valley of Scetis (modern-day $b_wadi_natrun$), so to join them she pretended to be an eunuch named Hilarion. Later, Hilaria’s younger sister, Theopiste, fell ill after being possessed by a demon and went to Egypt for treatment, where she was healed by the still disguised Hilaria. When Hilaria took care of her sister, the two women shared the same bed, and Emperor Zeno, scandalized that a “monk” would sleep with his daughter, demanded an explanation, and Hilaria had to reveal her true identity. Zeno, however, was touched deeply by his elder daughter’s spiritual devotion, and allowed her to return to Scetis as a “monk.” Despite the doubtful historicity of the legend, Hilaria became a saint in several eastern churches centuries after her purported death."
 FUL_MEDAMES_GLOSS: "#bold Ful Medames#!, or simply #bold Ful#!, is a stew made of fava beans mixed with various spices and herbs, that is often eaten for breakfast that is popular in Egypt and Sudan, where it is considered a national dish. Consumption of fava beans in this region dates back to Pharaonic Egypt, so the dish may have ancient origins. Less dubious records of the dish come from the medieval period; in medieval Cairo, for example, the making of #italic ful#! was monopolized by the inhabitants living near the Princess Baths, a public bath, as they took advantage of the fires used to keep the bathwaters warm. Huge cauldrons of #italic ful#! were kept simmering all day and night by the bathhouse to maintain a continuous supply of breakfast for Cairo’s population."
 HERMES_TRISMEGISTUS_GLOSS: "#bold Hermes Trismegistus#!, meaning #italic Hermes the Thrice-Greatest#!, is a legendary scholar, magician, and teacher who originated through syncretism of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. He was said to have composed the #italic Hermetica#!, a group of texts that laid the foundation for the #italic Hermetic#! philosophical tradition, which deeply influenced Hellenistic, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim thought into the early modern period."
 ABLEMBA_GLOSS: "In Sudanese folklore, #bold ablemba#! refers to supernatural mirages in the form of lights or lamps at night, that draw people away from their homes or safe roads. They are part of a broader umbrella of several kinds of supernatural phenomena or beings such as female spectres, jinn, and light-emitting snakes, that are believed to frequent around ancient or medieval Nubian ruins. These spirits, who in modern Sudan are believed to be of Christian origin, are seen as guarding the secrets of their domains from robbers and intruders, reflecting the locals’ views of their historical heritage."
 KARKADE_GLOSS: "#bold Karkade#!, also spelled #italic karkadeh#! or #italic karkadey#!, is a Middle Eastern and North African drink made from the dried petals of a type of hibiscus called the roselle plant (#italic Hibiscus sabdariffa#!). It is traditionally popular in Egypt and Sudan, particularly during Ramadan and on festive occasions like weddings, as the drink is believed to have health benefits. A typically way of preparing the drink is by soaking dried roselle petals into water, then boiling it, before mixing it other flavors as desired."

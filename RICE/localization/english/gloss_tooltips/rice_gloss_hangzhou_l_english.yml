 SHEN_GARDEN_GLOSS: "#bold Shěn Garden#! is one of the most famous landmarks in the city of Shàoxīng (historically called Kuàijī) in northeastern Zhèjiāng. The garden existed since at least the Sòng Dynasty, and is famously associated with the famously tragic love story between the poet Lù Yóu and his first wife, Táng Wǎn, who was forced to divorce. Eight years after the divorce, the two encountered each other by the garden, and exchanged poetry, before she passed away within a year. In old age, more than five decades later, in the last year of his life, Lù Yóu revisited the garden to write another set of famous poems, mournfully reflecting on love and the passage of time."

 # Note to non-Chinese Translators concerning the poems below:
  # I used one of the shorter translations to ensure the text could fit comfortably on a gloss tooltip.
  # Sadly, as we all know, translations can lose some of the nuances of the original (as the Italians say, "traduttore, traditore," i.e., "translator, traitor")
  # If you have time and want to refer to a variety of translations to decide which one is best for your needs, here's a few  English translations:

 LU_YOU_PHOENIX_HAIRPIN_GLOSS: "#bold Phoenix Hairpin#! (Lù Yóu)\n\n#italic Fine, pink hands; yellow sealed wine –\nThe town is filled with Spring’s colours but\nThe willows remain trapped within the palace.\nFine east winds, short happiness –\nGloomy spirits, separated for years.\nWrong! Wrong! Wrong!\n\nSame old Spring, haggard looks,\nSilk handkerchief stained pink with tears.\nPeach blossoms fall, ponds and pavilions empty.\nOaths and promises remain but brocade undelivered.\nNo! No! No!#!"
 TANG_WAN_PHOENIX_HAIRPIN_GLOSS: "#bold Phoenix Hairpin#! (Táng Wǎn)\n\n#italic Sympathy is lacking, people are unkind,\nRain at dusk cause flowers to tumble.\nDry whipping winds, drying sad tears.\nWishing to unfold matters of the heart,\nMurmuring alone by the banister.\nHard! Hard! Hard!\n\nOn our separate ways, we’re now different from before,\nThe ailing spirit often drifts and sways like the swing.\nCold horn signals, night will soon end.\nFear of being questioned,\nTears are awallowed to feign contentment.\nPretend! Pretend! Pretend!#!"

 SEA_NOMADS_GLOSS: "#bold Sea Nomad#! is a term applied to various ethnic groups in some parts of maritime Southeast Asia, who have traditionally, to varying extents, lived and traveled on boats and whose livelihoods depend greatly on the sea. These include the Orang Laut of Malaysia and Sumatra, the Moken on the border of Thailand and Malaysia, and the Sama-Bajau peoples of eastern Indonesia and the southern Philippines. Not all of these peoples are entirely nomadic or sea-based; some merely live by the coast and depend greatly on it. Regardless, historially, these peoples had close relations with kingdoms in the region; their skills were highly sought after, so they often served as mercenaries, pirates, merchants, and travel guides."
 GUNIG_GLOSS: "In the traditional beliefs of the Senoi peoples, a sub-category of the #italic Orang Asli#!, a collective term for the indigenes of peninsular Malaysia, #bold gunigs#! are spirit familiars who help people in various ways. Oftentimes, they find a #italic halaaq#! (also spelled #italic halaa#! or #italic halaa'#!), a ritual specialist somewhat analogous to a shaman, who they become attached to following a dream. Through this relationship, which is often seen as a rather intimate one, the #italic gunig#! can be summoned to protect or heal people, give advice, and assist in daily life."
 BAH_MALAYSIA_GLOSS: "Among the Aslian speakers of Malaysia, #bold Bah#! is typically a title of address reserved for men, often young men. At least in the modern day, it can have a mildly derogatory context as young men are seen as irresponsible and lacking in control."

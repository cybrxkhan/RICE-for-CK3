 RICE_sus_sijilmasa_legend_chapter_motivation_new_title: "Long ago, [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] was a city in turmoil. Founded by a motley mix of different peoples, they finally united as one thanks to an early ancestor of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. Generations later, when it was [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] to become a leader in the city, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] had great plans for the city, and to make it the envy of [GetGeographicalRegion('world_africa_sahara').GetNameNoTooltip]."
 RICE_sus_sijilmasa_legend_chapter_famous_deed_new_title: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] brought together the people of the oasis, and led them in many great projects. The city's builders constructed great feats of engineering, like the dams that diverted water from the Ziz River to improve the fertility of the oasis, or the walls that defended the city from foul attackers. The city's merchants spread their influence far and wide, so much that the coins minted at [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] are used throughout the region. Thanks to [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] leadership, [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] was a model city of peace and abundance, a jewel in the desert, a paradise on earth."
 RICE_sus_sijilmasa_legend_chapter_extra_deed_new_title: "All throughout the years, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] provided the oasis with the kind of leadership only a leader of great legend could have. [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe|U] was wise, leading the people with a just and righteous spirit."
 RICE_sus_sijilmasa_legend_chapter_conclusion_new_title: "Soon, word spread of the majesty and magnificence of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'title' ).Title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Explorers and adventurers from afar marveled at how such a magnificent city could exist in the desert. Whenever they asked the locals about this, the locals would say it was all the doing of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], for it was [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] and [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] family who inspired them to great deeds."

Alas, since his passing many years ago, [sijilmasa_county.GetNameNoTier] has been beset by decade after decade of conflict; not only have his descendants been lacking, but Sijilmasans - divided by religion and culture - have also turned on one another.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWe are tired of this senseless bickering. Whether through guile, wealth, might, or some combination thereof, I have convinced various parties in these feuds to sit together and negotiate a tenuous peace.

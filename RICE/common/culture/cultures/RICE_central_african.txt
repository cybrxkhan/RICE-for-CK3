# Older scholarship assumed they were Berbers who somehow migrated down to Darfur
# However, newer scholarship suggests if they were even real, they were indigenous, and could even be the ancestors of the Fur
# As such, I am interpreting them as proto-Fur, with their culture partly adapted from the Fur culture of Africa Plus
